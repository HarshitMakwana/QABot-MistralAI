        "content": "1.3Whatdo you meanbyTerritorial Waters,ContinentalShelf, ExclusiveEconomic Zone, any other Maritime Zone and Airspace above the territory andTerritorial Waters specified in Question No. 1.2?\nAns.Section 3(1) of the Territorial Act provides that the limit of the territorial waters is a\nline, every point of which is at a distance of 12 nautical! miles from the nearest pointof the appropriate baseline. Territorial waters would also include the seabed andsubsoil underlying such waters and the airspace over such waters. Furthermore, thelimit of the waters is with reference to the mainland of India as well as the individual\nor composite group or groups of islands constituting part of the territory of India.\nThe term baseline is not defined in the Act. However, Article 5 of the Convention ofthe Law of the Sea, 1982 refers to the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of\n. the territorial sea as the low water line along the coast as marked on the large-scale\ncharts officially recognised by the coastal States.\nIn the absence of a measurement: mechanism being provided under the Territorial\nAct, the distance of 12 nautical! miles from the baseline should be considered ordetermined in accordance with the customary international law.\nSection 6(1) provides that the continental shelf:\n\u2018comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond the limitof its territorial waters throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to theouter edge of the continental margin or to a distance of two hundred nautical milesfrom the baseline referred to in sub-section (2) of section 3 where the outer edge ofthe continental margin does not extend up to that distance\u2019.\nThe continental shelf would extend to the outer edge of the continental margin or to adistance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline.\nArticle 76(3) of the Convention of the Law of the Sea, 1982 provides that thecontinental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the land mass of thecoastal State, sea-bed and sub-soil of the shelf, siope and rise. It does not include thedeep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges and the subsoil thereof. The \"slope\" would\n \n1A nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kms. \nIntroduction3 \nrefer to the steep slope with which the shelf terminates and the \"rise\" refers to theless sharply sloping area between the slope and the seabed.\nSection 7(1) of the Territorial Act defines the exclusive economic zone as:\n\"an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial waters, and the limit of such zone\nis two hundred nautical miles from the baseline\u201d.\nHowever, section 9 of the Territorial Act provides that notwithstanding anythingcontained in the Territorial Act, where the maritime boundaries between India andother states, having coasts opposite or adjacent to those of India in regard to theirrespectiveterritorialwaters,contiguouszones,continentalshelves,exclusiveeconomic zone and other maritime zones, shalf be as determined by an agreementbetween India and such state, and pending agreement between India and any such\nstate. Unless any other provisional arrangements are agreed between them, themaritime boundaries between India and another state shall not extend beyond the\nline, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest point from which thebreadth of the territorial waters of India and another state is measured.\nThough the definitions of the various maritime zones are mutually exclusive, for thepurpose of the Act they would now practically be considered to apply to an area ofup to 200 nautical miles from the appropriate baseline.\nAirspace would cover the area over the territory and the territorial waters thatext\u00e9nds up fo airspace above12 nautical miles from the nearest point of theappropriate baseline. However, airspace would not extendto space above thecontiguous zones, continental shelves, exclusive economic zone and other maritimezones as defined under the Territorial Act.\nAirspace has not been defined and, hence, its meaning would have to be considered\nin accordance with international principlesor customary international laws. Anumber of schools of thought on what could constitute an airspace describe airspace\nas being equivalent to atmospheric space, any space where air is found, or where the\u2018area where an artificial satellite may be put in orbit or an area after which outer spacewould be considered. At the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,Forty-ninth Session, Vienna, 7-16 June 2006, the members considered that the lackof a definitionor delimitation of outer space brought about legal uncertaintyconcerning the applicability of space law and air law and those matters concerningstate sovereignty and the boundary between airspace and outer space needed to beclarified in order to reduce the possibility of disputes among states. However, theCommittee remained inconclusive on account of the fact that the current framework\non outer space was functioning well and there would not be a need to address thisconcern until such time as there was a demonstrated need and a practical basis fordeveloping a definition or delimitation of outer space. Any attempt to define ordelimit outer space would be a theoretical exercise, could lead to- complicatingexisting activities and might not be ableto anticipate continuing technologicaldevelopments.\nIt may seem that the perimeter which would limit the airspace of an orbiting satellitemay be considered as the most likely boundary to be accepted. However, in the \nA Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nabsence of a clear definition, thereis likely to be litigationin respect of whatconstitutes airspace.",

Where there are apparently contradictory rulings by the Supreme Court,\n \nthe decision of larger bench (whether earlier or later in point of time) should alwaysprevail. However, where the apparently irreconcilable decisions are given by bencheshaving equal number of judges, the principle of the later decision being applicablewould be attracted.\nDecisions given by a High Court, Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, etc. are binding on\nall the assesseesas well as the Income-tax Authorities which fall under theirjurisdiction, unlessit is over-ruled by a higher authority. The decision of a HighCourt is binding on the Tribunal and the Income-tax Authorities situated in the areaover which the High Court has jurisdiction.\nThe decision of one High Court is neither binding precedent for another High Courtnot for Courtsor Tribunals outsideitsterritorial jurisdiction.[C7T v ThaneElectricity Supply Ltd.

Accordingly, itwould stand to reason that CIT (Appeals) would be bound by the decision of theIncome-tax Appellate Tribunal.

Therefore,before the ship leaves the Indian port, the master of the ship is under an obligation tofurnish a return (such return may be submitted within 30 days of the departure of theship, if the Assessing Officer is satisfied that it will be difficult to submit the returnbefore departure and if satisfactory arrangement for payment of tax has been made)of the full amount earned on account of fare and freight (including the amount paid\nor payable by way of demurrage charge or handling charge or any other amount ofsimilar nature) and pay the tax accordingly. In this case, 7.5% of the amount of fare/freight/charge, etc shall be de\u00e9med to be income of such assessee on which theincome tax will be charged. Therefore, in this case the tax is chargeable on theincome in the same year in which it is eamed.\nWhere the Assessing Officer is satisfied that it is not possible for the master of ship\nto furnish the return before the departure of the ship from the port and the master ofthe ship has made satisfactory arrangement for the filing of the return and payment ofthe tax by any other person on his behalf, he (the Assessing Officer) may, if thereturn is filed within 30 days of the departure of the ship, deem the filing of theretum by the person so authorised by the master as sufficient compliance for thepurpose of this section.",

        "content": "1.34What are the provisions relating to charge of Income tax? What are theessential features of the same?\nAns.No tax can be levied or collected in India except under the authority of law. Section\n4 of the Income-tax Act, gives such authority for charging of income-tax. Where anyCentral Act enacts that income-tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any\nrate or rates, income-tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year inaccordance with, and subject to the provisioris {including provisions for the levy ofadditional income-tax) of, this Act in respect of the total income of the previous yearof every person. \nIntroduction19 \nAn example of additional income tax is tax on distributed income of domesticcompany for buy back of shares as per section 115QA.\nThe base for levy of tax in any assessment year is normally the income of theprevious year. However, in some cases, income-tax may be charged in respect of theincome_of a period other than the previous year. These have been discussed underexception to the previous year.\nAlthough income-tax is charged on the income of the previous year in the relevantassessment year, but income-tax shall be deducted at the source, or paid in advance,wherever it is so deductible or payable under any provisions of the Act.\nEssential features of the charge of income-tax: What is levied by virtue of theprovisions of section 4 is income-tax alone. Interest, penalties and fines, which arealso payable under the other provisions of the Act cannot be termed as income-tax.They are charged in addition to income-tax for the purpose of enforcing the levy ofincome-tax. The term \u2018income-tax\u2019 has however been held to include surcharge andadditional surcharge wherever provided. The characteristic features of the charge ofincome-tax are discussed below.It is the earning of the income that attracts thecharge and, hence, it will be inappropriate to say that income-tax, unlike levies like\nsales tax, excise duty, etc.,is paid or expended for the purposes of earning theincome:\n(a)Jncome-tax is an annual tax: It is imposed for each year called the assessmentyear (or the tax year), commencing from the1 April and ending with the 31stMarch immediately succeeding. Rates of tax are provided in the Finance Actsand not in the Income-tax Act. However, some special rates of tax are given inthe Income-tax Act.\n(6)Charge on person: This section brings to charge the total income.of the previousyear of every person. The definition of the expression \"person\u201dis given insection 2(31), It is an inclusive definition and is not exhaustive.\nIn some cases, a claim has been made that certain bodies do not fall within any\nof the definition of \u2018person\u2019 provided in clause (31} of section 2 due to solereason that they are not supposed to have any income or profits and gains. Toovercome such a situation the following explanation has been added to section2(31).'\nAn association of persons or a body of individuals or a local authority or an\nartificial juridical person shall be deemed to be a person, whether or not, suchperson or body or authority or juridical person, was formed or established orincorporated with the object of deriving income, profits or gains [Explanation tosection 2(31)].\nA State Government is also a person as it will fall under the category of artificialjuridical person and thus should be !iable to income tax. But Article 289(1) of theConstitution provides that the property and income of a State shall be exemptfrom Union Taxation. On the other hands, a local authority is a separate entityunder the definition of a person and thus shall be liable to income tax unless itsincome is exempt under section 10(20) of the Income Tax Act. \n20A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\n(ce)Charge in respect of total income: Total income in respect of which charge ismade is the aggregate of the incomes which are classified under five differentheads.\n(@)Charge in respect of income of the previous year: The income that is taken intoaccount as aforesaid for assessment in the assessment year (the tax base) is theincome of the previous year.\n(e)Exceptional case of charge for the current year: Though, as stated above, theincome charged is that of the previous year, there are certain exceptions to thisgeneral rule.\n(f)Each year is a self-contained accounting period: In Kikabhai Premchand (Sir) vCIT (1953) 24 ITR 506 (SC), the Supreme Court pointed out that the revenue isconcemed with the actual income, profits or gains made in each previous yearand not with any potential profits likely to be made in another year or with losses.likely to occur in the future.\n \n(g)Charge in respect of deductions at source and advance payments: The 1961 Actprovides the authority for collection of taxes by deductionat source or byadvance payments. The effect of deduction of tax at source and Advance tax isthat it amounts to payment of tax by the assessee concerned.\nThe liability for charge arises not later than the close of the previous year, though thequantification of the tax payable is postponed, owing to the rates of tax having to befixed by the Finance Act after the close of the previous year [Kalwa Devadattam vUnion of India (1963) 49 ITR 165 (SC)}.\nWhere amount of interest which accrued on grants received by assessee-society from\nState Government for various purposes including construction of houses for policeofficials could be used only for that purpose and in event it could not be used for thatpurpose, same has to be refunded back to Government, assessee was not recipient ofincome arising on account of interest earned on deposits with banks.

To illustrate, for calculating total income for the assessmentyear 2021-22, the provisions of the Act as on 01.04.2021are applicable. Any\namendment effected from 02.04.2021 would be irrelevant for calculating the totalincome for the assessment year 2021-22.\nIt is well settled proposition in the income tax law that in income tax matters, the law\nto be applied is the law in force in the assessment year unless otherwise stated orimplied. This proposition was laid down by the Supreme Court in [C/T v IsthmianSteamship Lines (1951) 20 ITR 572]. \nintroduction21\nFurther, it is well settled that the Income-tax Act, as it stands amended on the firstday of April of any financial year, must apply to assessment of that year. Anyamendment in the Act, which comes into force after the first of April of a financialyear, would not apply to the assessment for that year, even if the assessment isactually made after the amendment came into force [Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Lid vState of Kerala (1966) 60 ITR 262 (SC)].\nAmendment in income tax whether applicable from financial year or assessmentyear: Unless it is made clear in an amendment as to whether it comes in to effect forthe assessment year or financial year, normally it is to be deemed that such benefit ofthe amendment is for the assessment year [Mukesh C. Patel v CiT (2011) 238 CTR(Kar) 332 ].\nThe above proposition not applicable in case of procedural matters: The iaw ason thedateof the commencement of the assessment year may relateto{a)substantive rights, or (b) procedural matters.\nThe assessability, the method of computation of income, the exemptions or reliefpermissible, the rate of taxes and the right of appealor referenceall confersubstantial rights; they can neither be abridged or enlarged \u00a3, any change during thecourse of the assessment year, except by specific retrospective legislation butprocedural rights can be modified or changed at any time during the course of theassessment year. In such a case, it would take effect from the date of the amendment.To illustrate, if the rate of penal interest was changed from 1.25% to 1% w.e.f. 08-09-2010, then penal interest calculated for the assessment year 2010-11for theperiod after 08-09-2010 would be at 1% and not 1.25%, the rate as on 01-04-2010.Similarly, if any rate of TDS is changed or the exemption limit for which, no tax isdeductible is changed, it will be effective from the date mentioned in the relevantamendment.",

All receipts by an assessee cannot necessarilybe deemed to be income of the assessee for the purpose of income-tax and thequestion whether any particular receipt is income or not depends on the nature of thereceipt and the true scope and effect of the relevant taxing provision [MehboobProductions (P) Lid v CIT (1977) 106 ITR 758 (Bom)]. The income-tax authoritiescannot assess all receipts; they can assess only those receipts that amount to income.Therefore, before they assess a receipt, they must find that to be income. Theycannot find so unless they have some material to justify their finding [Lai ChandGopal Das v CIT (1963) 48 ITR 324 (All)].\nReimbursement of expenses does not amount to income: No part of reimbursement ofspecific and actual expenses received by the assessee which do not involve any markup can be treated as income of the assessee [Linklaters LLP v ITO (2010) 132 TTJ 20(Mum)].\nExcess cash received from customer is not income: Excess cash received at the cashcounters of the bank represents the liability to pay to the customers as and when theymay demand payment, therefore such excess cash collection cannot be considered as\nthe income of the assessee [CIT v Bank of Rajasthan Ltd (2010) 233 CTR (Bom)530].\nIn the facts of CIT v State Farming Corporation of Kerala Lid (1989) 180 ITR 669(Ker), it has been held that the penalties levied by the assessee on the contractorswere not receipts of the assessee but were only by way of reduction of expenditureand, therefore, not taxable.\nSimilarly, gifts exceeding aggregate amount of %50,000 in a previous year, fromunrelated persons shalt also be treated as income as per section 56(2)(x).

The assessee claims that it is nottaxable as income?\n \nAns.This case is based on a case decided by the Supreme Court in C/T v UniversalRadiators (1993) 201 ITR 800 (SC) in which the court held that in order that areceipt may not be taxable, the receipt should not only have been casual and non-recurring but it should also not have been a \u2018receipt arising from business\u2019.

Even illegal income is taxed just like any legalincome. By taxing such income, the State is not taking part in the crime or condoning\nit, nor would it become a principal or a sharer in the illegality. The revenue merelylooks at an accomplished fact, viz, on profits having been earned and assess thesame. The assessee may be prosecuted for the crime and yet be charged on the profit.Where the -assessee supplied penny-in-the-slot automatic machinesto licensedvictuallers and proprietors of places of public resort on a profit-sharing systembetween him and the occupier of the business, for which the assessee was liable to beprosecuted,it was held that the profits from suchactivity were neverthelessassessable. For example, the income earned from smuggling activities would also betaxable under the Act. if this were not so, then the illegal activity would be put at a\n_ premium becausea person carrying on this activity would get immunity from\npayment of taxes, while an honest tax-payer carrying on a legal business would bepaying taxes on his income.\nHowever, as per Explanation to section 37(1), any expenditure incurred by anassessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law shall notbe deemed to have been incurred for the purpose of business or profession and nodeduction or allowance shal! be made in respect of such expenditure.\nExplanation to section 37(1) is applicable only in case of expenditure pertaining to\nillegal business and not in the case of business loss [7.4. Quereshi v CIT (2006) 157Taxman 514 (SC)].\nThus, if there is business loss on account of illegal income, it is allowable but if anyexpenditure is incurred in earning that income it shall not be allowed as deduction inview of Explanation to section 37(1).\nInstances of tainted income: \nIntroduction27 \n(a)profits from wagering contracts [C/T v Chunilal B.

Forexample, if a businessman receives an extra amount from his customers specifically\nfor charity and is obliged by a contract or custom to utilise it for charitable purposesonly, the amount is received by him as a trustee for charity and cannot be taxed as hisincome [CIT v Tollygunge Club Ltd (1977) 107 ITR 776 (SC)].\nWhere an assessee does not alienate or assign the source of income, but merelyapplies the income so that it passes through their hands to be received by another, itwould still remain their income as it is a mere application of income received bythem. For example, where mines are leased by the proprietor to a creditor with adirection to apply the royalty income in liquidation of the debt owed, royalty incomewould be assessable as income in the hands of the lessor as it is a mere application ofincome' andnot diversionbyanoverridingtitle [C/T v Manager of KatrasEncumbered Estate (1934) 2 ITR 100 (Pat)].\nIn other words, where an assessee applies an income to discharge an obligation after\nthe income reaches the hands of the assessee, it would be an application of incomeand this would result in taxation of such income in the hands of the assessee.However, where there is a diversion of income before it reaches the hands of theassessee, it cannot be treated as an income of the assessee.\nIt may be very hard,in individual cases,to drawa line between whatis anapplication of income and what is a diversion de hors the assessee.\nThe assessee is an International player representing India and the Indian TennisAssociation open a development fund account in the name of the assessee and out ofthe remuneration payable to the assessee a part of it was retained and transferred into\nthe development find account. To determined whether the amount transferred to thefund constitutes the income of the assessee or not it is to be seems whether thedevelopment fund is created by the assessee on his own or at the instance of theassociation pursuant to the agreement entered in to between the association and theassessee and whether the assessee is entitled to claim the development fund from theassociation as a matter of right [C77 v Mahesh Bhupathi (2010) 43 DTR 159 (Kar)]. \n28A Compendiwun of Issues on Income Tax",

There is a difference between an amount which a person is obliged toapply out of his income and an amount which by the nature of the obligation cannotbe said to be part of his income of the assessee. Whereby the obligation, income isdiverted before it reaches the assessee,it is deductible; but where the income isrequired to be applied to discharge an obligation after such income reaches theassessee, the same consequence in law does not follow. It is the first kind of paymentwhich can truly be excused and not the second. The second payment is merely anobligation to pay another a portion of one\u2019s own income which has been receivedand is since applied. The first is a case in which the income never reaches theassessee, who even if he were to collect it, does so, not as part of his income but forand on behalf of the person to whom it was payable [C/T v Sitaldas Tirathdas (1961)41 {TR 367 (SC)].\n \nIt is only when income or a portion of income is diverted at the source by anoverriding title before it started flowing into the channel which was to reach theassessee concerned that it could be excluded from his assessable income [C/T v L.Bansi Dhar (1968) 67 ITR 374 (Del)}.\nDiversion or application of income: An obligation to apply the income in a particularway before it is received by the assessee or before it has accrued or arisen to theassessee results in the diversion of the income. On the other hand, an obligation toapply income which has accrued or arisen or has been received amounts merely to\nthe apportionment of the income, and nottoits diversion [Raja Bejoy SinghDudhuria v CIT (1933) 1 ITR 135 (PC)}.\nWhere the income accrues to the assessee directly and is merely applied, upon suchaccrual, to discharge an obligation of the assessee, it is a case of mere application ofthe income of the assessee [Vibhuti Glass Works v CIT (1989) 177 ITR 439 (SC).\nPayment made by assessee to its retiring partners were a self-imposed obligationbeing gratuitous and hence, application of income not allowable as deduction [S. B.Billimoria & Co, y ACIT (2010) 125 ITD 122 (Mum)j.\nIt is not every obligation to apply income in a particular way that results in diversion\nof income before it reaches the assessee. Unless and until there is an overridingobligation, the amount received from the assessee cannot be treated as income of theperson receiving the amount [Arvind Singh v CIT (1986) 160 ITR 908 (Raj)].\nIn case of diversion of income by overriding title, person in whose favour income is\nto diverted should be aware about exact amount of such income which it has earned.\nIf such fact is not proved to the: satisfaction of Assessing Officer, such income shallbe taxabie in the hands of the recipient [U.P. Bhumi Sudhar Nigam v CIT (2005) 280ITR 197 (Ail)]. \nIntroduction29\nIf the obligation is on the receipt of the income and not on the source of it, the legaleffect is different. In the one case, income is diverted at source and hence cannot bedeemed to have accrued or arisen therefrom.In the other case, the income hasaccrued and therefore, it has to be applied in a particular manner.

Anypayment by him to such relations in discharge of that personal obligationwould be merely an instance of an application by the assessee of a part of hisincome [C77 v Lakshmi Narayan (1981) 132 ITR 355 (Mad)].\n(2)The circumstance that a decree is passed by a court of law, either by consent orotherwise, for the payment of such maintenance would not take the case out ofthe category of application of income.\n(3)Where the assessee-society received royalties and after deducting expenses andcreating reserve fund, distributed the royalties among its members, it was heldthat the royalties were the assessee\u2019s income and it had merely applied it in aparticular way [Performing Right Society Ltd v CIT (1977) 106 ITR 11 (SC)].\n(4)Ifa lawyer conducting the defence for an accused in a criminal trial stipulates\nfor a fee stating that he would create a public charitable trust thereof, the saidamount when received by the lawyer cannot be said to have been divertedaway before reaching the lawyer. The expression of a desire on the part of thelawyer to create a charitable trust is not tantamount to an actual creation of the\ntrust. Consequently, the money, when received by the lawyer, cannot but beregarded as his professional income in toto, The position however, would bedifferent if such an accused (the donor) had resolved to create a charitable trust\nin memory of the professional aid rendered to him by his lawyer and had madethe lawyer a trustee for the money so paid to him and setting out the objects of\nthe trust [C77 v Thakur Das Bhargava (1960) 40 ITR 301 (SC)].\n(5)Where the assessee, a race club, claimed a deduction of the net proceeds of therace on certain days on the ground that the races on those days had been heldspecifically for charity, it was held that there was no legal obligation on thecomunittee to spend the proceeds for such purposes, that the beneficiaries wereuncertain and that it was only a case of application of income [Madras RaceClub v CIT (1985) 151 ITR 675 (Mad). \nIntroduction31\n(6)The assessee inherited a property under a will left by his father with thecondition that he wouid give a certain monthly maintenance allowance to hismother and pay %10,000 each to the unmarried sisters at the time of theirmarriage. The assessee got married his sister in the relevant year and claimeddeduction of the amount on the ground of an overriding charge on theproperty. It was held that the assessee might have been obliged to meet theexpenditure of his sister\u2019s marriage out of the income from the propertybequeathed on him. But such an obligation could not be equated with anoverriding charge on the property. For an overnding charge, the obligationshould be of such a nature as to divert the income beforeit reaches theassessee [CIT v Satish Pai (P) (1986) 162 ITR 457 (Kar)].\n(7)Income from property, thoughit was paid as maintenance allowancetodependents under a decree of court (without the maintenance being chargedupon the property yielding income) [CIT v Sitadas Tirathdas (1961) 41 ITR367 (SC)].",

What is the effect of thischarge and the alimony payment on the taxable income in the hands of R?\nAns.The above case is quite similar to the case decided by the Supreme Court in C/T vSttaldas Tirathdas (1961) 41 ITR 367. In the said case, the court held that the true\ntest for application of the mule of diversion of income by an overriding charge iswhether the amount sought to be deducted, in truth, never reaches the assessee as hisincome. There are, no doubt, obligations\u201din every case, butitis the nature ofobligation which is the decisive factor. There is a difference between an amountwhich a person is obliged to apply out of his income and an amount which by thenature of the obligation cannot be said to be a part of the income of the assessee.Where by obligation the income is diverted beforeit reaches the assessee,itisdeductible; but where the income is required to be applied to discharge an obligation\nafter such income reaches the assessee, the same consequence, in law, does notfotlow. It is the first kind of payment which can truly be excused and not the second. \n32A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nThe second payment is merely an obligation to pay another portion of one\u2019s ownincome. The first is a case in which the income never reaches the assessee, who even\nif he was to correct it, does so not as part of his income, but for and on behalf of theperson to whom it is payable.\nIn the present problem, R has discharged the obligation after the income reaches hishands, The arrangement with the employer by creating a first charge is merely anobligation which would come into effect only after the amount reaches R as salary.Hence, amount paid by R to his ex-wife shall not be deductible and the entire amountshall be salary in the hands of \u2018R\u2019.",

Will it make any difference if such gift isreceived by a businessman or professional?\nAns.The value of any gift, or voucher, or token in lieu of which such gift may be receivedby the employee or by member of his household on ceremonial occasions orotherwise from the employer, shall be determined as the sum equal to the amount ofsuch gift.\nHowever, where the value of such gift, voucher or token, as the case may be, isbelow 25,000 in the aggregate during the previous year, the value of perquisite shall\nbe taken as nil.\nFurther, as per section 56(2)(x)), gift of money received by an individual or HUFfrom unrelated persons shall be fully taxable if the aggregate sum of money received\nas gift from one or more person exceeds 750,000.\nGift in kind received from unrelated persons shall also be taxable in certain cases.For detailed discussion see Chapter on Income under the Head \u2018Income from OtherSources\u2019.\nPersonal gift received by a businessman/professional vis-a-vis gift received duringthe course of business or profession: If the recipient of the gift is a businessman or aprofessional, the fact does not alter the character of the thing given. Hence, it will betreated as personal gift and its treatment shall be same as given in (viii) above. On\nthe other hand, if the gift is received during the course of carrying on any business orprofessionit will be taxable as per section 28(iv) being the value of benefit orperquisite, whether convertible into money or not, arising from business or exerciseof a profession.\nWhetherthisissoor notin any given case would depend uponso manyconsiderations such as, the nature of the business, the relationship between the giverof the gift and the recipient and various other circumstances.\nWhere the devotees out of natural love and affection and veneration used in largenumbers on the birthdays of the assessce and voluntarily made gifts, it cannot be saidthat the amount received by the assessee by way of gift would amount to vocation orprofession sinceitis not the case of the Department that the devotees werecompelled to make gifts on the accasion of the birthday of the assessee and thereforethe same were not taxable as income in the hands of the assessee [C/T v GopalaNaicker Bangaru (2010) 46 DTR 280 (Mad)]}. However, the aggregate amount ofsuch gifts shall now be taxable as per section 56(2)(vii).\nAre prizes/ awards/rewards received by a sportsman, who is not a professional,taxable in his hands?\n1 58\nAns.The Central Board of Direct Taxes had occasion to consider the question whether theaward received by a sportsman, whois not a professional, will be taxable in hishands or not. In the case of a sportsman who is a professional, the award received byhim will be in the nature of a benefit in exercise of his profession and, therefore, willbe liable to tax under the provisions of the Income-tax Act. However, in the case of anon-professional, the award received by him will be in the nature of a gift and/or \nIntroduction35\npersonal testimonial. In view of this, it is clarified that such awards in the cases of asportsman, who is not a professional, will not be liable to tax in his hands as it wouldnot be in the nature of income. The question whether a sportsman is a professional ornot will depend vpon the facts and circumstances of each case to be decided by theAssessing Officer [Circular No. 447, dated 22-1-1986].Hence, gifts/prizes/awards/rewards received by a non-professional sportsman wouldnot be income under section 2(24) in his hands by virture of Circular No. 447, dated22.1.1986. Further, in case of all such receipts the question of applicability of section10(17A) or section 56(2){v) (now section 56(2)(vii)) does not arise [Abinav Bindra vDCIT (2013) 35 taxman.com 575 (Del)(Trib)].",

        "content": "1.62Why is the distinction required between capital receipts and revenue receipts orcapital expenditure or revenue expenditure?.\nAns.The Income-tax Act makes no mention regarding the distinction between revenuereceipts and capital receipts. Similarly, it has not mentioned any distinction betweencapital expenditure and revenue expenditure or between capital loss or revenue loss.However, a distinction between these terms is of great importance for the purpose ofincome tax. This is so because a revenue receipt is taxable as income, unless it isexpressly exempt under the Act. On the other hand, a capital receipt is generallyexempt unless it is expressly made taxable. Further, income tax normally allowsrevenueexpenditureasdeduction whilecomputingincomeandnotcapitalexpenditure. Similarly, it allows revenue loss but not capital loss in computing the\ntotal income. Further, a particular item may be capital in one case while the same\n. may be revenue in other case.\nIt is often a controversy between the taxpayer and the Department as to whether aparticular receipt is a capital receipt or a revenue receipt. So many decisions areavailable on this aspect that it often baffles even an expert to offer certain clear tests\nto suggest whether a receipt is on capital or revenue account. The deciding line isthin and one aspect which has been time and again emphasized by several HighCourts and the Apex Court is that each case should be decided on its own facts andsurrounding circumstances.\nThough it would be difficult to lay down what are the tests which are relevant andnot relevant in the context of determination of the nature of the receipts, study ofvarious decisions gives an insight into the same.\nAs the Supreme Court has observed, in the context of determining the capital orrevenue nature of an expenditure, in Empire Jute Co. Lid v CIT (1980) 124 ITR 1(SC), the capital or revenue nature of an expenditure and similarly the capital orrevenue nature of a receipt had been a vexed question and this question has \u2018alwayspresented a difficult problem, and continually baffle the Courts, because it has notbeen possible, despite occasional judicial valor, to formulate a test for distinguishingbetween capital, and revenue expenditure which will provide an infallible answer in\nall situations. There have been numerous decisions where this question has beendebated but it is not possible to reconcile the reasons given in all of them, since eachdecision has turned upon some particular aspects which has been regarded as crucialand no general principal can be deducted from any decision and applied blindly to adifferent kind of case where the constellation of facts may be dissimilar and otherfactors may be present which may give a different hue to the case. Often cases fall onthe border line and in such cases, as observed by Lord Green MLR. in IRC v British\n \n1Inserted by Finance Act, 2018, w.e.f. 1-04-2019. \n38A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nSalmson Aero Engines Lid (1938) 22 Tax Cases 39 (CA) the spin of a coin woulddecide the matter almost as satisfactorily as an attempt to find reasons.",

        "content": "1.63Outline the relevant tests for determination of nature of receipts.\nAns.(i) Capital sales versus business sales: The receipt would be on capital accountwhere the transaction merely amounts to change of investment or is for the purposesof realisation of capital. Where, however, such transaction is one entered into in theordinary course of business, it would be a revenue receipt.\nProfits arising from the sale of a capital asset are chargeable to tax as capital gainsunder section 45 whereas profits arising from the sale of a trading asset, being ofrevenue nature, are taxable as income from business under section 28 provided thatthe same is in the regular course of assessee\u2019s business, or the transaction constitutes\nan adventure in the nature of trade.\n(ii) Nature of the initial receipt an important factor: The character of the receipt at its\ninitial stage plays a vital role in determining whether it is a capital or revenue receipt.This is clear from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Morley v Tattersall TC 13R264 in which it was held that if a particular amount is not received as a tradingreceipt in the course of the business at the first instance, it would not subsequently beregarded as a trading receipt due to change of things or circumstances.\n(iii) Fixed capital versus circulating capital: A receipt referable to a fixed capital is acapital receipt, while what is referrable to circulating capital or stock in-trade of anassessee would be a revenue receipt. What is a fixed capital for a person may be acirculating capital for another. A machinery would be a fixed capital for a personwho uses the same in his trade for manufacture of an article, while it would becirculating capital for the machinery manufacture. For an ordinary investor, shareswould be fixed capital, but for a dealer in shares, it would be circulating. capital..--\nProfit on realisation of fixed capital would be on capital account, and may attractcapital gain tax while the same on realisation of circulating capital would be arevenue receipt. The Supreme Court in CIT v Vazir Sultan & Sons TC 38R 925 hasapplied this principle.\nWhere the assessee,a firm, was appointed as sole selling agent by a companymanufacturing cigarettes for the Hyderabad State in the year 1931 and subsequently\nin the year 1939 that agency was extended even in respect of the sales outside theHyderabad State but in the year 1950 the said agency was restricted and confinedonly to the Hyderabad State and payment was made to the assessee as compensationfor the toss by way of resiriction of the area of the agency, it was held that theagency formed the capital asset of the company and the amount received by theassessee as Compensation was a capital receipt and not income from business [C7T vVazir Sultan (1959) 36 ITR 175 (SC)]. However, although it is capital receipt it hasbeen specifically included as income under section 28(2)(i).\n(iv) Test in the hands of the recipient: In deciding whether a certain receipt is income\nor not, the test is its character in the hands of the recipient and not character in thehands of the payer, nor the fund out of which the money came. What may beregarded as capital in the hands of the payer may yet be income in the hands of payee[CIT v Vazir Sultan & Sons (1959) 36 IFR 175 (SC). \nIntroduction39 \nWhere the assessee had teak trees on her land which had been planted long ago, andwhich had been cut and completely removed from the land together with rootsthereof for the purpose of rubber plantation on the land, it was held that the saleproceeds of the trees was not income liable to tax but was a capital receipt in thehands of the assessee [Vishnudatta Antharjanam v Cag IT (1970) 78 ITR 58 (SC)].\nOn the other hand where the trees were not removed with roots and the stumps of thetrees were allowed to remain in the land so that the trees may regenerate, it is anincomeliabletotax under the Income-tax Act andis nota capital receipt[Venugopala Verma Rajah v CIT (1970) 76 ITR 460 (SC)j.\n(v) Casual or recurring receipts: One test that is sometimes adopted is whether thereceipt is a casual receipt or whether it is a recurring receipt: if the former, it iscapital: if the latter, it is revenue. But this is not an unfailing test, for an annual orperiodic receipt may be capital, and a single receipt may yet be revenue. So also, itcannot be said that only recurring receipts can be income and all non-recurringreceipts should always be capital in nature [Yogam (SMDP) v CIT (1985) 154 ITR624 (Ker).\n(vi) Premium receipts: Premium received by an owner in consideration of the grantby him of a licence to realise a capital asset belonging to the owner is capital, but anysum received by the owner for his allowing another to use the capital asset is revenue[Maharaja Chintamani Saran Nath Sah Deo v CIT (1961) 41 ITR 506 (SC)].\n(vit) Perpetual or life annuity in exchange of a capital asset: Where an owner of anestate exchanges a capital asset for a perpetual annuity ie annual instalments, theamount of annuityis ordinarily taxable in his hands. On the other hand, if heexchanges his estate for a capital sum payable in instalments; the instalments whenreceived would not be taxable income [C/T v Kunwar Trivikram Narain Singh(1965) 57 ITR 29 (SC); National Cement Mines Industries Ltd v CIT (1963) 42 ITR69 (SC)].\n(viti) Payer\u2019s motive not material: In determining whether a payment amounts to areturn for loss of a capital asset or is income, profits or gains liable to tax, one musthave regard for the nature and quality of the payment, if the payment was notreceived to compensate for a loss of profits of business, the receipt cannot properlybe described as income, profits or gains as commonly understood. To constituteincome, profits or gains, there must be a source from which the particular receipt hasarisen, and a connection must exist between the quality of the receipt and the source.\nIt the payment is by another person, it must be found out why that payment has beenmade. It is not the motive of the person who pays that is relevant. More relevanceattaches to the nature of the receipt in the hands of the person who receives it though\nin trying to find out the quality of the receipt one may have to examine the motiveout of which the payment was made. The fact that the amount paid was large or that\nit was periodic in character, or described as pay remuneration, etc, do not determine\nits quality [Divecha (P.H.) v CIT (1963) 48 ITR 222 (SC)].\n(ix) Profit motive: The existence or absence of profit motive is also neither decisivenor conclusive for arriving at a decision whether a particular receipt is income or notbecause even in the absence of a motive to earm income, the assessee may derive \nA Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nincome and would still be chargeable to tax [Vishnudatta Antharjanam (A.K.T.K.M.)\nv Cag IT (1970) 78 ITR 58 (SC)j.\n(x) Nomenclature of transaction irrelevant: The character of the receipt either ascapital receipt or as income should not be based on the name given to the amountreceived by the assessee in his records because, in law, the real nature and characterof the transaction must be determined in the light of the terms of the contract and therights and obligations of the parties flowing therefrom unguided by the nomenclatureof the transaction [National Cement Mines Industries Ltd v CIT (1961) 42 ITR 69(SC)].\n \nHowever, the nomenclature of the transaction or receipt as used by the partics maybe of assistance to the Revenue to arrive at a view in regard to the intention of theparty even though the nomenclature is not decisive particularly when the transaction\nis between two businessmen who are conversant with such phraseologies [C/T vPanbari Tea Co. Ltd (1965) 57 YTR 422 (SC)].\nA mere book-keeping entry cannot be income, unless income has actually resulted[CIT v Shoorji Vallabhdas & Co. (1962) 46 ITR 144 (SC)].\n(xi) Entry in the books of account of a hypothetical income does not result in incomesubject to tax: income tax is a levy on income. No doubt, the Income-tax Act takesinto account two points of time at which the liability to tax is attracted, viz, theaccrual of the income or its receipt; but the substance of the matter is the income. Ifincome does not result at all, there cannot be a tax, even though in book keeping, anentry is made about a \u2018hypothetical income\u2019, which does not materialise. Whereincomehas,infact,beenreceivedandissubsequentlygivenupinsuchcircumstances that it remains the income of the recipient, even though given up, theincome may be taxable. Where, however, the income can be said not to have resulted\nat all, there is obviously neither accrual nor receipt of income, even though an entry\nto that effect might, in certain circumstances, have been madein the books ofaccount. Where the company provided for additional remuneration to the directorssubject to the approval of the Central Government but made no application for theapproval and the directors forgo the additional remuneration prior to the end of theprevious year, it was held that the additional remuneration does not accrue and ishence not taxable [Seth Madan Lal Modi v CIT (2003) 261 ITR 49 (Del)].\nUnder the income-tax Act, income is to be computed not of the basis of accountingtreatment but on the well-established principles of law interpreted by the Courts onthe basis of law of income tax. The company credited a certain percentage of thedeposits collected from customers under a finance scheme as administrative andprocess charges in the profit and loss account. Later, it filed a revised computationduring the assessment proceedings claiming that the sum credited is part of thedeposit received whichis erroneously credited in the profit and loss account.Itclaimed that the receipt is capital in nature. It was held that the Court is compelled togo by the true nature of the receipts and not go by the entry in the books of accountand therefore held that the entire receipt of collection from the depositor is a loansum being capital in nature despite being shown in the profit and loss account asincome [CiT v Sahara Investment India Ltd (2004) 136 Taxman 61 (AlD]. \nIniroduction41 \n(xii) Treatment as income by the assessee is not conclusive: A receipt which in lawcannot be regarded as income cannot become so merely because the assessee haserroneously credited it to the profit and loss account [C/T v Stewarts & Lloyds ofIndia Lid (1987) 165 ITR 416 (Cal); CIT v India Discount Co. Ltd (1970) 75 ITR191 (SC)}.\n(a)Power subsidy received from State Government year after on actual powerconsumptionis revenue receipt: The power subsidy was granted after thecommencement of production, and it was to the extent of 10% or 12.5%, as thecase may be. This was given on actual power consumption and had nothing todo withthe investment subsidy givenfor establishmentof industriesorexpanding industries in backward areas. The power subsidy given as part of anincentive scheme, after commencement of production, should be treated assubsidy linked to production, and therefore, a revenue receipt [CIT v RassiCements Ltd.

Sugar MillsLtd. v CIT (2014) 361 ITR 637 (All).\n{c)Concept of mutuality cannot be extended to interest on fixed deposit with bank:\nIn order to be an income derived from activities based on principle of mutuality,\nit must be shown that contributions have been made by contributors and samecan only be expanded or retumed to contributors [C77 v Dehradun Club Ltd.(2013) 212 Taxman 269 (Uttarakhand)].\n(xvi) Sales tax receipts and refunds: It is now settled law that sales tax charged andcollected from customers as part of the bills is in the nature of a trading receiptassessable to income tax. In the case of an assessee who maintains his accounts on\nthe mercantile system, sales tax collected but not paid to Government pendingadjudication of dispute over his liability to pay sales tax is a revenue receipt of theyear in which it is collected [CIT v Nagai Reddy (T.) (1993) 202 ITR 253 (SC)).\n(xvii) Tax payable by assessee collected from customers: The assessee, a dealer ingrains and grocery, was under an obligation to pay mandi tax. The assessee collectedthe amount of tax from its customers and credited it in the balance sheet in thataccount. It was held that the assessee was not following the mercantile system ofaccounting and, as such, the mandi tax collected by him from the customers was\nliable to be taxed as its income [Dhariwal Sales Enterprises v CIT (1988) 171 ITR212 (MP).\n(xviii) Mesne profits: The mesne profits received by the assessee under the consentdecree granted by the Apex Court was capital receipt not chargeable to tax [NarangOverseas Pvt.

In Sutlej Cotton Mill Lid v CIT (1979) 116ITR1(SC), the Supreme Court enunciated the principlein this regardin thefollowing words:\n \nThe law may, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that where profit or lossarises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value offoreign currency held by it, on conversion into another currency, such profit or losswould ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the-assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capitalembarked in the business. But, if on the other hand, the foreign currency is held as acapital asset or as fixed asset, such profit of loss would be of capital nature.\nWhere the assessee earned commission in dollars: An assessee in India carried onmoney-lending business in Saigon. For the purpose of the business, the assessee had\nto remit rupees from India to be converted into dollars at Saigon, at the current ratesof exchange, for the purposes of lending there. Likewise, profits made at Saigon indollars when remitted to India had to be converted into rupees at the then currentrates of exchange. It was held that the profit or loss due to the fluctuations in therates of exchange was on trading account, The money remitted to Saigon or themoney which came back from Saigon was the money-lender\u2019s stock-in-trade and thatany depreciation or appreciation of the currency was on revenue account.\nAn assessee carried on the business of export of cashew nuts and used to enter intoforward contracts of sale with foreign buyers in the course thereof. In all transactionsincluding the forward contracts, the price was quoted in dollars. On 6 June, 1966,when the Indian rupee was devaluated the assessee was entitled to receive dollars forexport actually effected before that date and also on account of forward contractsentered into earlier and by reason of the devaluation the assessee received a greateramount in rupees and a surplus accrued in the hands of the assessee. The High Courtheld this surplus to be a trading profit as it represented part of the sale proceeds. Itwas found that the assessee had become entitled to receive a larger amount in termsof rupee as price of the goods [Shamsuddin & Co. (M) v CIT (1973) 90 ITR 323\n(Ker)]..\nOn Capital Asset: Where the assessee having earned commission in dollars retainedthe amount so eamed in the USA, with the permission of the Exchange ControlAuthorities for purchase of capital goods there but the purchases having not beenmade in the USA in view of the restrictions imposed by the Government on importsfrom America, the assessee repatriated the amount to India with the permission of the \nIntroduction45 \nReserve Bank of India, which resulted in a surplus to the assessee in view of the fact\nthat in the meanwhile there was a revaluation of the Indian mpees, it was held thatthe surplus amount was received by the assessee by capital accretion and not profittaxable in the hands of the assessee [C77 v Tata Locomotive & Engineering Co. Lid(1966) 60 ITR 405 (SC)].\n\nWhere the assessee, a bank, had 2 branch in Karachi before partition of Indian in1947 and in that branch it never carried on foreign exchange business and the moneywas lying idle in Pakistan as the assessee did not carry on any banking businessthere, but after the devaluation of the Indian rupee, permission was granted by theState Bank of Pakistan for remittance of the amount by the assessee from Pakistan toIndia and a profit resulted to the assessee on account of the devaluation by makingremittance of its money to India, it was held that the profits did not result to theassessee in the course of any trading operations and was a capital receipt in its hands[CiT v Canara Bank Ltd (1967) 63 ITR 328 (SC)).\nThe assessee had obtained a loan of \u00a350,000 from a foreign company which wasconvertible into equity shares. There was an increase in the value of this amount due\nto the devaluation of the Indian rupee. It was held that the said amount was not partof the circulating capital employed in the business of the assessee.It was fixedcapital earmarked for the particular purpose of being converted into equity shares ofthe borrower. The amount representing the increase in the value of the loan was acapital receipt [Triveni Engineering Works Lid v CIT (1985) 156 ITR 202 (Del)].\nAny gain on account of foreign Exchange fluctuation in respect of equity sharesissued overseas by way of GDR\u2019s is to treated as capital receipt irrespective of theend use of the share capital [C/T v Jagatjit Industries Ltd (2009) 32 DTR 168 (Del):(2010)191 Taxman 54(Del)].

In Shamilal Narula (Dr)v CIT, theSupreme Court observed that the interest is a payment to be made by the debtor to\n484 Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nthe creditor when money was due to the creditor but was not paid or in other wordswas withheld from the creditor by the debtor after the time when the payment.shouldhave been made. Proceeding further, the Supreme Court observed that interest,whether it was statutory or contractual, represented the profit the creditor would havemade if he had the use of the money which he was entitled to. Thus, the amount ofinterest received for delay in payment of compensation does not also partake of thecharacter of capital andis clearly a revenue receipt chargeable to income tax[Sivaram Prasad Bahadur (S.R.\u00a5.)v CIT & Yachendra Kumararaja (Raja ShriV.V.V.R.K.) v ITO (1971) 82 ITR 527 (SC)].",

In their case, for thatprevious year only first condition shall be applicable.\n2.The aboveconditions, with exceptions may be calledas category\u2018A\u2019conditions.\n3.A person is said to be of Indian origin if he, or either of his parents or any ofhis grand parents was bor in undivided India [Explanation to Section115C(e)].\n \n4In order to avoid genuine hardship due to COVID-19, the Board has decidedthat for the purpose of determining the residential status under section 6 ofthe Act during the previous year 2019-20 in respect of an individual who hascome to India on a visit before 22.3.2020 and:\nJudicial decisions \n(a)has been unable to leave India on or before 31,.3.2020, his period of stay\nin India from 22.3.2020 to 31.3.2020 shall not be taken into account; or(b)has been quarantined in India on account of Novel Corona Virus (Covid-19) on or after 1.3.2020 and has departed on an evacuation flight on orbefore 31.3.2020or has been unableto leave India onor before31.3.2020, his period of stay from the beginning of his quarantine to hisdate of departure or 31,3.2020.\n(c)has departed on an evacuation flight on or, as the case may be, shall notbe taken into account; or before 31.3.2020, his period of stay in Indiafrom 22.3.2020 to his date of departure shall not be taken. (CircularNo.11 dated 8.5.2020)\nMeaning of employment: The term employment is not defined in the Income-tax Act,\nas such we may refer to some other judgments where some judges have defined theterm \u2018employment\u2019. In the case of Westall Richardson Lid. v Roulson (1954) 2 AER448, the honourable Judge Denma, J stated that the word \u2018employment\u2019 is one of verywide significance. But the words \u2018employer and the \u2018employee\u2019 are much restricted intheir meaning. Thus, I may be said to employ my time or my talents without being inany proper sense an employer, andI may also be paid to be employed in somepursuit or activity without being an \u2018employee\u2019. \nScope of Total Income and Residential Status55 \nA man may employ himself so as to earn profits in many ways. Thus he can set up anindependent practice abroad or businessman can shift his business activities toaforeign country.\nTaking up own business by the assessee abroad satisfies the condition of goingabroad for the purpose of employment covered by Explanation (a) to section 6(1)(c)and therefore, assessee was entitled to claim his status to be non-resident for therelevant period [C/T v O. Abdul Razak (2011) 56 DTR 133 (Ker)].\n\nTravelling abroad on business visa to take up any employment or for any businesscarried outside India is sufficient to prove this condition [X. Sambasiva Rao v ITO(2014) 42 taxmann.com 115 (Hyd)j.\nA person merely undertaking tours abroad in connection with his employment inIndia would not be eligible for the relaxation provided under Exception1 [JTO vPatel (K.Y.) (1990) 33 ITD 714 (Bom) (AT)].\nThe Bureau Chief of Japanese Broadcasting Corporation was functioning from Delhiand he had to gather news in South Asia. For this purpose, he travelled outside India.\nIt was held that salary for the periods he was outside India accrued in India andtaxable in India [ACIT v Hiromi Hirose (2008) 298 ITR (AT) 269 (Del)].\nIn termsof section6, how canthe term\u2018going abroadfor purposeofemployment\u2019 be explained?",

For the purpose of the Explanation anindividual need not be an unemployed person who leaves India for employmentoutside India. The fact that the individual was already an employee at the time ofleaving India is hardly material or relevant and hence salary income received by theemployee of an Indian company who was in India for less than 182 days and who hasbeen deputed outside India shail not be taxable in India as he was non-resident in thatprevious year [British Gas India Pvt. Lid, In re (2006) 155 Taxman 326 (AAR)].\nAssessee, already employed in India, left India for the purpose of employment, and\nin the relevant year, his residential status, according to provisions was of non-resident. AO contended that since assessee was already employed in India, held thatincome of assessee is taxable in India, as assessee is resident in India. Thus, was heldthat the fact that assessee was already employed in India, shall not have effect on his\n56A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nstatus of non-resident, thus income accrued outside India, will not be taxable in India[Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax v Raj Jain (2013) 38 taxmann.com 133(Delhi - Trib)].\nExample: R a citizen of India is an employee of Wipro India Ltd. He leaves Indiafor the first time on 22.9.2020 for USA for completing an overseas project of theemployer company and he is to come back after 9 months. In this case R will beallowed the benefit of exception given above, since his total stay in India during theprevious year 2020-21 is less than 182 days. Thus he will be non-resident in India forthe previous year 2020-21 and salary earned by him outside India shall not be taxable\nin India.",

What is the meaning of \u2018place ofeffective management\u2019 inserted by the Finance Act, 2016?\nUnder the existing section 6(3), due to the requirement that whole of control andmanagement should be situated in India and that too for whole of the year, thecondition had been rendered to be practically inapplicable. A company could easilyavoid becoming a resident by simply holding a board meeting outside India. Thisfacilitated creationof shell companies which wereincorporatedoutsidebutcontrolled from India. \u2018Place of effective management\u2019 (POEM) is an internationallyrecognized. concept for determination of residence of a company incorporated in aforeign jurisdiction. Most of the tax treaties entered into by India recognise theconcept of 'place of effective management\u2019 for determination of residence of acompany as a tie-breaker rule for avoidance of double taxation. Many countriesprefer the POEM test to be appropriate test for determination of residence of acompany. The principle of POEM is recognized and accepted by Organisation ofEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also. The OECD commentary onmodel convention provides definition of place of effective management io mean theplace where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for theconduct of the entity's business as a whole, are, in substance, made.\nThe modification in the condition of residence in respect of company by including\nthe concept of effective management would align the provisions of the Act with theDouble Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) entered into by India with othercountries and would also be in line with international standards. It would also be ameasure to deal with cases of creation of shell companies outside India but beingcontrolled and managed from India. \nScope of Total Income and Residential Status65 \nIn view of the above, the following Explanation has been inserted under section 6(3)\nto give the meaning of place of effective management:\nExplanation\u2014For the purposes of this clause \"place of effective management\"means a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary\nfor the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made.\nSince POEM is an internationally well accepted concept, there are well recognisedguiding principles for determination of POEM althoughitisa fact dependentexercise.

In a secondary sense, the two words together mean \u2018to become a presentand enforceable right\u2019 and \u2018to become a present right of demand\u2019. Strictly speaking,the word accrue is not synonymous with arise, the former connoting the idea ofgrowth or accumulation and the latter of the growth or accurnulation with a tangibleshape so as to be receivable.\nExample: Interest on securities will accrue day to day but will arise on the specifieddate whenit will become due for payment. Similarly, salary for work due for\n \n1Interest on recognised provident fund was exempt under section 10 up to 9.5% till 1-8-2010. It was reduced\nto 8.5% w.e.f. 1-9-2010. However, as per Notification No. 24/2011, dated 13-5-2011,it has again beenenhanced to 9.5%, wenejf 2-9-2050. \nScope of Total Income and Residential Status71 \npayment. Similarly, salary for work done in November will accrue throughout themonth, day to day, but will become due or arise at the end of the month.\nThere is a distinction in the dictionary meaning of these words, but throughout theAct they seem to denote the same idea or ideas very similar and the difference only\n\nlies in this that one is more appropriate when applied to a particular case [CIT vAhmedbhai Umarbhai & Co. (1950)18 ITR 472, 496 (SC)j.It will indeed bedifficult to distinguish between the two words, but it is clear that both the words areused in contradistinction to between the word \u2018receive\u2019 and indicate a right to receive(Seth Pushalal Mansinghka (P) Ltd v CIT (1967) 66 ITR 159 (SC)].\nDate and time of accrual: The time of accrual or arisal is of significance in taxation,since, in order, to be chargeable, the income should have accrued or arisen to theassessee during the previous year. In order that income may be said to have accrued\nat a particular point of time, it must have ripened into a debt at that moment, that is tosay, the assessee should have acquired a right to receive payment at that moment,though the receipt itself may take place later. Until, there is created in favour of theassessee a debt due by somebody, it cannot be said that any income has accrued tohim [Sassoon & Co. Lid (ED) v CiT (1954) 26 ITR 27, 52 (SC)].\nTalk time charges received by the assessee, a telecom service provider, on the sale ofprepaid cards are to be recognised as income of the relevant year only to the extent\nthe talk time has been actually used by the customers, and the amount referable to theunused talk time is to be recognized as income in the subsequent year when the talk\n~time is actually used [4C/T v Shyam Telelink Ltd (2013) 151 TTJ 464 (Del) (Trib)].\nNormally, where goods are dispatched by the seller under a FOB (Free On Board) orFOR (Free On Rail) or FAS (Free Alongside Ship) contract, the sellers contractual\nliability ceases as. soon as he delivers the goods on ship or on rail or alongside theship and the title in the goods can be said to have passed as soon as this is done and\nas such the sale would be complete and income would arise at such place. However,\nin case of goods dispatched under a CIF (Cost, insurance and freight) contract, the\ntitle to goods passes at a place where the documents relating to title to the goods arepassed over to the buyer on payment or acceptance or promissory note or bill ofexchange.\nWhen an assessee has no right to claim the amount from the other party to theagreement or to enforce the claim before the date specified in the agreement, incomedoes not accrue to the assessee immediately on execution of the agreement. Incomeaccrues only when the assessee acquiresa right to receive the same. To sayitdifferently, income can be said to accrue on a date when debt becomes due in viewof a catena of decisions of the Supreme Court including the decision in C/T v AshokBhai Chimman Bhai (1965) 66 ITR 42 (SC).\n72A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax ",

        "content": "2.42How does the method of accounting affect the concept of accrual and arisal ofincome and the receipt of the income?\nAns,Income is liable to be taxed on the basis of its accruing or arising to the assessee, or\nits receipt by the assessee, during the relevant previous year. The accrual or arisingof income is generally dependent on the method of accounting employed by theassessee. In the cash system of accounting, the accrual or arising of the income willbe simultaneous with its receipt. In the mercantile system of accounting, the accrualof income is not independent of its receipt. So long as the amount is due to theassessee, the system of accounting would envisage the amount being treated ashaving accrued to the assessee [CIT v Planters Co. (P) Lid (1980) 124 ITR 648, 650-51 (Mad)]. In the mercantile system of accounting, the profit or loss at the end of theaccounting period is based not on the difference between what was actually receivedand what was actually paid out, but on the difference between the right to receive andthe liability to pay.\n \nHowever, it has been especially provided that in case of income from salaries, theliability to tax arises immediately when income is due to the assessee irrespective ofthe method of accounting followed.\nLikewise, in the case of dividends, the income would be included in total income ofthe shareholder under section 8 in the year in which final dividend is declared and in\nthe case of interim dividend in the year in which they are made unconditionallyavailable to the shareholders.\nWhere the assessee carrying construction activity, had contracted for retention of10% of the contract amountas retention money which was payable after thecompletion of the contract, it was held that such money accrued to the assessee onlyafter the completion of contract and final inspection and on the basis of bills. Henceno enforceable liability has accrued or arisen prior to such date. [C/T v East CoastConstruction & Industries Ltd. (2007) 160 Taxman 399 (Mad)}] However, it will nowbe treated as income as per Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS).\nIn mercantile system of accounting, interest \u2018on security deposits lying with theExcise Department should be included on accrual basis. [Kerala Highway Corpn.(1995) 51 TTY 508 (Coch) (AT)].\nMethod of accounting not to affect the range of taxable income: The regular mode of\u2018accounting determines only the mode of computing the taxable income and the pointof time at which the tax liability is attracted. Where no income has resulted, it cannotbe said that income has accrued merely on the ground that the assessee had beenfollowing the mercantile system of accounting.\nThe concept of accrual of income depends on the interests/rights of the partiesconcerned and not by the method of accounting followed by the assessee. Thus,although wherethe accountsof an assessee following mercantile methodofaccounting are prepared on accrual basis, taxability thereof is decided by the fact of \n Scope of Total Income and Residential Status73\naccrual and not by the method of accounting followed by the assessee. Where theincome has arisen has to be examined in the context of commercial principles[Poona Electric Supply Co. v CIT (1965) 57 ITR 521 (SC)]-\nTaxability of income: A profit can be said to have accrued or a liability or loss can besaid to have been incurred only when the profit is either actually due or the liabilitybecomes enforceable. A mere claim to a profit or to a liability is not sufficient tomake the profit to accrue or the liability to be incurred for the purposes of theIncome-tax Act [C/T v Associated Commercial Corporation (1963) 48 ITR1(Bom)].\nMere sending of bills for goods sold charging a rate which was never payable doesnot amount to accrual of income embedded in those bill amounts. Sending the billsamounted merely to making a claim and does not create a legal enforceable right forthe amount [C/T v Nadiad Electric Supply Co. Ltd (1971) 80 ITR 650 (Bom)].Similarly, the mere posting of an entry in the account books of the assessee wouldnot always supply conclusive evidence on the question whether the disputed amountshave accrued to the assessee or not [C/T v Western Indian Engineering Co. (1971)811 ITR 712 (Guj)).\nIncome can be said to have accrued when a person acquires an enforceable right toreceive the amount. Thus, where an amountis received as an advance towardsincome, it cannot be said to have accrued at the time of receipt because the same isreceivedasadeposit,and income would accrueonly whenthe amountisappropriated towards the income receivable [CIT v Surendra Overseas Ltd (1982)136 ITR 553 (Cal)].\nWhere assessee was engaged in business of providing telecom services to bothprepaid and postpaid subscribers, unutilized amount on prepaid card at end of yearwas to be treated as advance in balance-sheet and recognized as a revenue receipt insubsequent year, when talk time was actually used or was exhausted.

The expression business connection, however, is not defined in theAct. it is manifest that the words in section 9{1} and section 163 of the Act arecomprehensive enough to include all heads of Income mentioned in section 14 of theAct. It is, no doubt, true that there is specific reference to business in section 9(1) ofthe Act and there is no reference to profession.

The argument for the assessee was that no each paymentwas involved. The High Court found that the non-resident received 85% of the catch.\nIn fact, the non-resident had no control over the catch, so that it was only afterhanding over the catch in Indian shares; it came under its contro] of the non-resident,This would mean that instead of the charter fee being received in cash,it wasreceivingat the agreed share of the catch, so thatit was held, is liable for taxdeduction at source. This decision has now been affirmed in Kanchanganga SeaFoods Lid. v CIT (2010) 325 ITR 540 (SC): (2011)1 STD 649. Liability for theresident under section 201 was, therefore, upheld by the Supreme Court.\n \n(5) Assessee-company was engaged in sale and export of sea food and for thatpurpose it obtained permit to fish in exclusive economic zone of India. To exploitfishing rights, it entered into an agreement, chartering two fishing vessels with a non-resident company. Charter fee was payable from eamings from sale of fish and forthat purpose 85% of gross earnings from sale of fish was to be paid to non-residentcompany. Actual fishing operations were done outside territorial waters of India butwithin exclusive economic zone. Thereafter, chartered vessels with entire catch werebrought to Indian Port, catch were certified for human consumption, valued, andafter customs and port clearances, non-resident company received 85% of catch. Itwas held that non-resident company effectively received charter fee in India andsame would be chargeable to tax under section 5(2).

Assessing Officer on such factsheld commission so paid to be deemed to have been received in India andcharged tax thereupon. Tribunal held that merely because commission were paid\nto foreign agents in their bank accounts by telegraphic transfer through banks in\nIndia, it could not be said that income were deemed to have been arisen to suchforeign agents in India when there was no material on record to show that suchforeign agents had rendered any part of services in India or had a permanentestablishment and business connection in India [4CIT v Avon Organics Lid.(2013) 55 SOT 260 (Hyd) (Trib)j.\n \nIn view of Circular Nos. 23 dated 23-7-1969, 163 dated 29-5-1975 and 786 dated7-2-2000, export commission paid to non-resident agent for services renderedoutside India, shall not be taxablein India.

Itwas held that all that seems to have been done by LO falls within parameters ofsupplying information which is preparatory and auxiliary to formation of finalcontracts entered into by applicant with VESL, therefore, applicant's LO in India isvery much covered within exclusionary clauses (e) and (f) of article 5(4) of DTAAand, consequently, cannot be regarded as a permanent establishment of applicant.[K.T.

However, the terms of the contract showed that the agreementwas primarily one of consultancy.

The performance ofemployees of LO was determined by number of direct orders received by them.Employees were also entitled to sales incentives for these orders. Such incentiveplans established that LO was not engaged merely in preparatory or auxiliaryactivities. Its activities extended to marketing activities as well. Therefore, it wouldbe treated as PE of foreign company and the income attributable to LO activitieswould be taxable in India.

Where\nthe equipment and material is manufactured and procured outside India, the incomeattributable to the supply thereof could only be brought to tax if it is found that thesaid income therefrom arises through or from a business connection in India.ftcarmot be concluded that the Contract provides a \"business connection\" in India andaccordingly, the Offshore Supplies cannot be brought to tax under the Act.\nIn order to fall outside the scope of section 9{1}(vii) of the Act, the link between thesupply of equipment and services must be so strong and interlinked that the services\nin question are not capable of being considered as services on a standalone basis andare therefore subsumed as a part of the supplies. In view of the Explanation tosection 9{2) as substituted by Finance Act, 2010 with retrospective effect from01.06.1976, the decision of the Supreme Court in Ishikawajima-Harima HeavyIndustries, in so far as it holds that in order to tax fees for technical services under\nthe Act the services must be rendered in India, is no longer applicable. Therefore, inthe event the services in question are not considered as an integral and inextricablepart of equipment and material supplied, it would be fee for technical services and itwill be necessary to examine whether any relief in respect of such income would beavailable to the assessee by virtue of the DTAA between Germany and India [LindeA.

Further there were certain issues in respect of income deemed to accrue or arise\nwhere there were conflicting decisions of various judicial authorities.\nThe legislative intent of this clause was to cover incomes, which were accruing orarising directly or indirectly from a source in India. The section codifies the sourcerule of taxation, which signifies that where a corporate structure is created to routefunds, the actual gain or income arises only in consequences of the investment made\nin the activity to which such gains are attributable and not the mode through whichsuch gains are realized. This principle which supports the source country's right to\ntax the gains derived from off shore transactions, where the value is attributable tothe underlying assets, is recognised internationally by several countries.\nTherefore following Explanations have been inserted w.r.e.f. 1-4-1962 for providingcertainty of law:\nExplanation 4-\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the expression\u201cthrough\u201d shall mean and include and shall be deemed to have always meant andincluded \u201cby means of\u201d, \u201cin consequence of\u201d or \u201cby reason of\u201d. \nScope of Total Income and Residential Status97 \nExplanation $.\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that an asset or acapital asset being any share or interest ina company or entity registered orincorporated outside India shall be deemed to be and shall always be deemed to havebeen situated in India, if the share or interest derives, directly or indirectly, itsvalue substantially from the assets located in India.\n\u201cProvided that nothing contained in this Explanation shall apply to an asset or capitalasset, which is held by a non-resident by way of investment, directly or indirectly, in\na Foreign Institutional Investor as referred to in clause (a) of the Explanation tosection 115AD for an assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April,2012 but before the 1st day of April, 2015.\" [First proviso inserted w.r.e.f. 1.4.2012]\"Provided further that nothing contained in this Explanation shall apply to an asset orcapital asset, which is held by a non-resident by way of investment, directly orindirectly,inCategory-Ior Category-IIforeignportfolioinvestorundertheSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations,2014, made under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.\" [Secondproviso inserted w.r.e.f. 1.4.2015]\nAmendment made by the Finance Act, 2020\nExplanation 5 modified [W.e.f. A.\u00a5. 2020-21]\nThe Finance Act, 2012, inter alia, had inserted Explanation 5 to said clause to clarifythat an asset or capital asset being any share or interest in a company or entityregistered or incorporated outside India shall be deemed to be and shall always bedeemed to have been situated in India if the share or interest derives, directly orindirectly, its value substantially from the assets located in India. Second proviso tosaid Explanation,inserted throughthe FinanceAct,2017, providesthattheExplanation shall not apply to an asset or capital asset, which is held by a non-resident by way of investment, directly or indirectly, in Category-I or Category-ILforeign portfolio investor under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (ForeignPortfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 [SEBI (FPI} Regulations, 2014].\nVide Gazette Notification No. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2019/36, SEBI has notifiedSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors} Regulations,2019 {SEBI (FPI) Regulations, 2019] and repealed the SEBI (FPI) Regulations,2014. The difference between these two regulations pertinent in the present context\nis that the SEBI has done away with the broad basing criteria for the purposes ofcategorization of portfolios and has reduced the categories from three to two. In viewof the same, necessary modification needs to be made in the proviso so inserted.\nHence, the Finance Act, 2020 has provided that the exception from said Explanation\n5 provided to an asset or a capital asset, held by a non-resident by way of investment\nin erstwhile Category I and Il FPIs under the SEB] (FPI) Regulations, 2014 may begrandfathered. Further, similar exception may be provided in respect of investment\nin Category-I FPI under the SEBI (FPI) Regulations, 2019. \n98A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \n Clarification on Indirect Transfer provisions in case of redemption of share\nor interest outside India under the Income-tax Act, 1961\nThe provisions of section 9(1)(i) of the Act read with Explanation 5 thereof shallnot apply in respect of income accruing or arising to a non-resident on account ofredemptionor buyback of its share or interest held indirectly(i.e. throughupstream entities registered or incorporated outside India) in the specified funds ifsuch income accrues or arises from or in consequence of transfer of shares orsecurities held in India by the specified funds and such income is chargeable to tax\n \n \nin India.

Similarly,if a lead bank obtains loans outside India from aconsortium of foreign banks and lends the same to an Indian concern, interestpaid by the lead bank to the members of the consortium will not attract liabilitytowards income-tax in India [Circular No. 202, dated 5-7-1976].\n \n \nInterest means interest payable in any manner in respect of any moneys borrowed ordebt incurred (including a deposit, claim or other similar right or obligation in) andincludes any service fee or other charge in respect of the money borrowed or debtincurred or in respect of any credit facility which has not been utilised.\nThe definition is very wide and covers interest payable in any manner in respect ofloans, debts, deposits, claims and other similar rights or obligations.

The viewexpressed in the CBDT circular has not found favour in these judicial decisions. If\nthe legal fiction created under the treaty is treated to be of limited effect, it wouldlead to base erosion. The interest paid by the permanent establishment to the headoffice or other branch etc. is an interest payment sourced in India and is liable to betaxed under the source rule in India. This position is also recognised in some of ourDTAAs in particular the Indo-USA DTAA in Article 14(3) reads as under:-\n\"In the case of a banking company which is resident of the United States, the interestpaid by the permanent establishment of such a company in India to the head officemay be subject in India to tax in addition to the tax imposable under the otherprovisions of this Convention at a rate which shall not exceed the rate specified inparagraph 2(a) of Article 11 (interest)\u201d\nThe Special Bench of the ITAT in the case of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation(136 ITD- 66 TBOM] had mentioned that there are instances of other countriesproviding for specific provisions in their domestic law which allows for the taxabilityof interest paid by a permanent establishment to its head office and other branchesand had pointed out absence of such a specific provision in the Income-tax Act,\n\u2018Considering that there are several disputes on the issue which are pending and likely\nto arise in future, it is essential that necessary clarity and certainty is provided for inthe Act. Accordingly, the Act has inserted the following Explanation in section9CL)():.\nInterest payable by the Permanent Establishment in India of a non-residentbeing a person engaged in the business of banking to its head office or any PE\nor any part of such non-resident outside India shall be deemed to accrue orarise in India [Explanation inserted after section 9(1)(v)(c), w.e.f.

Section 9(1)(vii}\nis a special provision for that type of income and section 9(1)(i) is general in nature[CIT v-Copes Vuican Inc.

However, the factsof the case as indicated in the agreement, clearly establish that what is paid asengineering fee is in the nature of \u2018fees for technical services\u2019 and therefore, bothunder section 9{1)(viz) as well as under DTAA, it should be taxable in India.

It was held that the services rendered by overseas service providerswould not fall within ambit of technical services as given in Explanation 2 to section9(1)(vii) instead they were in nature of commercial services and amount received forsuch services constituted business profit and hence the same is not taxable in India asoverseas service provider does not have any PE in India [Yash Raj Films P.

The sourcerule would mean that irrespective of the situs of the services, the situs of the payerand the situs of the utilisation of services will determine the tax jurisdiction.\nFurther, section 5, which defines scope of total income, is subject to other provisionsof the Act, which would include section 9, and the income deemed to accrue or arise\nin terms of section 9 gets covered under section 5. Income does not have to actuallyacctue or arise in India to be deemed to accrue or arise in India.\nIn the case of Ishikawajma-Harima Heavy Industries Ltd v Director of Income Tax(2007) 288 ITR 408 (SC), it was held that despite the deeming fiction in the saidsection, for any such deemed income to be taxable in India, there must be sufficientterritorial nexus between such income and the territory of India. Further, it was heldthat where any sum is payable to a non-resident by a resident, the deeming sweep of\nthe said section cannot bring to tax, any income of a non-resident received outside\n. India from Indian concerns for services rendered outside India. In regard to fees fortechnical services, it was specifically held that for the fees to be taxable in India, theservices have not only to be utilised in a business in India, but also have to berendered in India.Legislative intent for introduction of clauses (v), (vi) and (vii) was to give legalsanctity to the source rule. This source rule is also recognised in India's DoubleTaxation Avoidance Agreements. Hence, for removai of doubts, an Explanation tosection9 was inserted w.r.e.f.1.6.1976to specifically reaffirm the source ruleprovided in that section, to clarify that:\n\u2018where income is deemed to accrue or arise in India under clause {v), (vi) or (vii)\nof section 9(1), such income shall be included in the total income of the non-resident, regardless of whether the non-resident has a residence or place ofbusiness or business connection in India. In such cases, it is not necessary toestablish the territorial nexus between the income deemed to accrue or arise to\nthe non-resident under the above clauses and the territory of India.\u2019\nAmendment made by the Finance Act, 2010\nThe Kamataka High Court, in a judgement thereafter in the case of Jindal ThermalPower Company Lid v DCIT (TDS), has held that the Explanation,in its presentform, does not do away with the requirement of rendering of services in India for anyincome to be deemed to accrue or arise to a non-resident under section 9. It has beenheld that on a plain reading of the Explanation, the criteria of rendering services inIndia and the utilization of the service in India laid down by the Supreme Court in its \n116A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \njudgement in the case of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Ltd v DIT (2007)288 ITR 408 (SC) remains untouched and unaffected by the Explanation.\nIn order to remove any doubt about the legislative intent of the aforesaid source rule,\nthe Act hassubstitutedthe existing Explanation witha new Explanationtospecifically state that the income of a non-resident shall be deemed to accrue or arise\nin India under section 9(1)(v) (relating to interest paid outside India) or section\n9(1)}(vi) (relating to royalty paid outside India) or section 9(1)(vii) (relating to fee fortechnical services paid outside India) and shall be imcluded in his total income,whether or not,\u2014\n(a)the non-resident has a residence or place of business or business connection inIndia; or\n \n(b)the non-resident has rendered services in India.",

Similarly,if the fund manager locatedin.

Further,presence of the fund manager under certain circumstances could lead to the off shorefund being held to be resident in India on the basis of its control and managementbeing in India.\nFurther there are a large number of fund managers who are of Indian origin and aremanaging the investment of offshore funds in various countries. These persons arenot locating in India due to the above tax consequence in respect of income from theinvestments of offshore funds made in other jurisdictions.Therefore in order to facilitate location of fund managers of off-shore funds in India,an amendment has been brought in by the Finance Act, 2015 by inserting section 9A\nto resolve these issues so that it may fall in line with international best practices.",

To treat any income or revenue in the nature of rent, there shouldbe an established relationship of a landlord and tenant or lessor and lesseebetween the parties. For example, the share of agricultural produce receivedby a landlord is though in kind but it is rent and thus agricultural income. \nIncomes which do not form Part of the Total Income135\n(b)Revenue from Land: The expression \u201cany revenue\u201d would mean income ofevery kind derived from agricultural land, other than:\n(a)rent, or\n(6)the income which falls under section 2(1A)(b) and (c).\n(c)Rent or revenue should be derived from land: This would mean that suchrent or revenue should spring from land or arise from land. If the immediateand effective sourceis. not land, the income cannot be considered to beagricultural income. The following incomes will not be agricultural income\nas these are not derived from land.\neDividend received bya shareholder froma company carryingonagricultural operationsis not agricultural incomein his hands, Theshareholder receives the dividend not by virtue of any activity ofagriculture carried on by him, but by virtue of the investment of hisfunds in the company in buying up its shares.\neLoan obtained by a shareholder out of accumulated profits of a companyhaving only agricultural income, which is liable to be treated as \u201cdeemeddividend\u201d, is not agricultural income in the hands of the recipient.\neInterest on arrears of cess or rent payable by a tenant to his landlord is nodoubt revenue but it is not revenue derived from land and hence it is notagricultural income.\neCommission eared by a broker for selling agricultural produce of an,agricuiturist is not agricultural income.\n\u00a2Salami or Nazarana paid shall not be agriculture income in the hands ofthe recipient unless it is a payment of rent in advance.\neReceipts from the supply of water tank in an agricultural land. \nAny capital gain arising from the transfer of agricultural land is not treated asrevenue derived from land and hence it is not agricultural income [Explanation1\n \nto section 2(1A)].\n(2) Land should be situated in India\nLand should be situated anywhere in India, though, it may or may not be subject toland revenue or any local rate. The land may be situated in an urban area or in a ruralarea, If the land is located outside India, any agricultural income derived from suchland will not be deemed to be agricultural income and the same will not enjoy anyexemption under section 10(1). In the case of a person residing in India, such incomefrom agricultural land situated outside India will be included in his total worldincome and would be liable to tax.\n(3) The Land should be used for agricultural purposes\nThe Supreme Court in CIT v Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy (1957) 32 ITR 466 (SC)has held that the land is said to be used for agricultural purposes where the followingtwo types of operations are carried out on such land: \n136A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \n(a)Basic Operations: These involve cultivation of the ground, in the sense of tillingof the land, sowing of the seeds, planting and similar operations on the land.Such basic operations demand the expenditure of human labour and skill upon\nthe land itself and further they are directed to make the crop sprout from theland.\n(b)Subsequent Operations:Afterthecropsproutsfromtheland,therearesubsequent operations which have to be resorted to by the agriculturists for theefficient production of the crop such as, weeding, digging the soil around thegrowth, removal of undesirable growths, prevention of the crop from insects andpests and from depredation by cattle and tending, pruning, cutting, etc\n \nBoth the basic and the subsequent operations together form the integrated activity ofthe agriculturist. The performance of the subsequent operations on the produce of theland would not be enough to invest the subsequent operations with agriculturalcharacter. They should be in conjunction with, and in continuation of, the basicoperation which is the sine gua non of an agricultural operation. In other words,basic operations must be performed before any income is called agricultural income.\nThe basic operation need not necessarily be tilling of the iand, sowing of the seeds orplanting; it may be an operation of a similar kind. Instead of tilling (involving the use-of a plough) the soil may be broken with the aid of a shovel where the soil is loamy.A crowbar and spade wouid be enough for digging pits in the soil to plant a sapling.Ploughing is mostly necessary for sowing seeds and not for planting.\nThe kind of basic operation required would depend upon the nature and kind of thecrop intended to be raised. However, this sine gua non operation should be on theland itself. Without the operation on the land by way of interfering with the ground\nor the soil, there would be no agricultural operation within the meaning of thedefinition.\nIncome from sale of forest trees of spontaneousor natural growth where onlyforestry operations in the nature of these subsequent operations are performed would,therefore, not be agricultural income [Maharjadhiraj Sir Kameshwar Singh v CIT(1957) 32 ITR 587 (SC)]. However, where fresh trees have been planted in oldforests, the income attributable to such plantation activity would be agriculturalincome.\nThe nature of the produce raised has no relevance to the character of agriculturaloperation. The produce which is the result of applying human skill and effect to aturemight cater to the needs of man or animal or may cater to the heads of industry.\nAn income to be \u201cagricultural income\u201d should be derived from land and the landshould be used for agricultural purposes, In other words, there should be a nexusbetween income, land and agriculture operations, by which is meant something done\nto the land by human or mechanical agency to produce out of the land any crop, tree,plantation or other produce or product. The immediate source of the income must beland of the description or character mentioned in the definition [C77 v Imam Saheb(K.S.) (1969) 71 ITR 742 (Mad)}. \nIncomes which do not form Part of the Total Income137 \nRent is a technical conception, its leading characteristic being that it is a payment inmoney or in kind by one person to another in respect of the grant of a right to usejand for agriculture purposes. Thus if agriculture produce is received as rent it will beagricultural income [CAg/T v Jaganath Rao (P.V.) (1962) 45 ITR 396 (Ori)].\nInterest on arrears of rent payable in not agricultural income. It is not part of the rent,nor is it an accretion to it, though it is received in respect of it. Equally clearly theinterest on rent is revenue, but it is not revenue derived from land [C7T v RajaBahadur Kamakhaya Narain Singh (1948)16 ITR 325 (PC); Maharaja RamRamvijaja Parshad Singh v Province of Bikar (1949) 17 ITR 164 (Pat)].\nPerson buying the standing crops cannot claim the profit from the sale of standingcrops as agricultural income. Agricultural income cannot be said to accrue to everyperson in whose hands the produce of the land passes. It is only the owner, landiord\nor ryot, or persons having a derivatives interest in the land from these persons thatcan be said to derive income from ithe land by the performance of agriculturaloperations on it.\nRent, revenue or income derived from land by agriculture in section 2(1A) hasreference to the rent, revenue or income derived by a person having some interest inland, and by virtue of the fact that he is the owner of that interest [CIT \u00bb MaddiVenkatasubbayya (1951) 20 ITR 151 (Mad)].:",

It may become necessary to perform a process on theproduceto makeit marketableorsaleable.Such process maybecalled\u201cmarketing process or agricultural process\u201d for the sake of convenience: Thegain in the value of the produce by such marketing process or agriculturalprocess is also classified as income from agriculture. If marketing process isperformed on agricultural produce which could be sold without such process asthe produce was itself marketable, the income attributable to the process shail notbe agricultural income. Eg sugarcane can be generally sold as such, therefore theprocess of conversion of sugarcane into gur shal] not be a process necessary to \n138A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nbe applied where there is a market for sugarcane being sold as such [BrikanMaharashtra Sugar Syndicate Lid v CIT (1946) 14 ITR 611 (Bom)].

If any other processes have been performed, the sale proceedswill have to be disintegratedto find out that part ofit which constitutesagricultural income, so as to exempt that part alone from Income-tax.\n \nThus, the income derived from processing of agricultural produce or sale of produce\nso processed would qualify for exemption if the following conditions are satisfied:\n1.The agricultural produce processed is raised by the assessee.\n2.The process employed is\u2019 one which is usually employed by the cultivator orreceiver of rent in kind.\n3.The process has been employed with the object of making produce marketable.\nThe employment of the process must not however, change the character of theproduce and it must retain its original character [Dooars Tea Co.

Lid v CAIT (1962) 44 ITR 6 (SC)]. However, if theproduct of agriculture has a market of its own, the income attributable to the processnot ordinarily employed by a cultivator to render the produce fit to be taken to themarket will have to be treated as non-agricultural income. Thus where there wasmarket for eucalyptus leaves, the profit,on extraction of eucalyptus oil from leavesgrown by the assessee is non-agricultural income [C?T v Stanes Amalgamated EstateLtd (1998) 232 ITR 443 (Mad)].\nSection 2(1A)(b) does not contemplate sale of commodity different from what iscultivated and processed.

In this case the company has compositeincome ie from agriculture and from business. The composite income has to bedisintegrated and for computing business income the market value of any agriculturalproduce raised by the assessee or received by him as rent in kind and utilised as rawmaterial in his business is deducted. No further deduction is permissible in respect ofany expenditure incurred by the assessee as a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind.For computing agricultural income the market value of agricultural produce will betotal agricultural receipt on account of potatoes. From such agricultural receipts,expenses such as cultivation expenses, etc, incurred in connection with such receiptwill be deducted and the balance will be agricultural income which will be exempted.\nFor example, in the above case, if the market value of the potatoes grown by thecompany, which have been used for the purpose of making its own wafers, is 75 lakhand the cost of cultivation of such potatoes is 74 lakh. From the business income ofwafers %5 lakh ie the market value, shall be deducted and no other expense shall beallowed for such potatoes. On the other hand, the agricultural income shall be 71lakh (5 lakh \u2014 4 lakh). This agricultural income of %1 lakh shall be exempt.\nMarket in the context of rule 7 does not mean an open market where buyers andsellers get together for the purpose of purchase and sale of goods. No specialsignificance can be read into the phrase ordinarily sold. The principle that the valueof a property will be the price which it will fetch if sold in the open market is a well-known method of valuation, which has been adopted in a large number of statutes inEngland and also in India. There may or may not be an actual market where buyersand sellers congregate to purchase and sell goods. Where there is no-such openmarket, an estimate of the market price will have to be done on a hypothetical basis[Thiru Arooran Sugars Ltd v CIT (1997) 227 ITR 432 (SC)].\nWhere the assessee was engaged in cultivation of oil palm and processing andextraction of crude palm oil from fruit as well as from kernel, it was held that incomefrom such activity shall be classified as agricultural or industrial income and as persub-rule (2) of rule 7, the market value of the agricultural produce, being palm fruitwith pulp and kernel, shall be the income attributable to agricultural operations andactivity of extracting oil shall constitute industrial activity, income from which shallbe taxed under the head Income from business and profession [Oil Palm India Ltd. vAssistantCommissionerof Income-taxCircle-](2012)19taxmann.com138(Kerala): (2012) 206 Taxman 1 (Ker)].",

AO held that inaccordance with section 10(2A), deduction in respect of income which has notsuffered tax incidence in the hands of partnership firm shall not be exempt in thehands of the partner, and accordingly disallowed the part of profit in the hands ofpartner, It was held that since partnership firm itself was not liable to pay tax in suchincome by virtue that tax on such income has been paid either in the form ofdividend tax or securities transaction tax at the time of sale of shares, incomedistributed to partners as part of profits shall not be taxed in the hands of partners[Vidya Investment & Trading Co.

Accordingly, the entire profitcredited to the partners\u2019 accounts in the firm would be exempt from tax in the hands\nof such partners, even if the income chargeable to tax becomes NIL in the hands ofthe firm on account of any exemption or deduction as per the provisions of the Act.[Circular No. 8/2014, dated 31-3-2014] \n154A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax",

Thereafter, the question as towhether the quantum of payment is adequate or inadequate, or, is or is not in excessof requirement is irrelevant. Thus, if the purpose of payment is to meet the cost ofeducation of a person, no further explanation is called for in order to exclude theamount from the taxable income under section 10{16).\nThe exemption of scholarship depends on what is meant to be by the person paying\nor disbursing. In the event it is paid only for meeting the cost of education, the factthat the recipient does not spend the whole amount towards education or that he isable to save something out of it is irrelevant and does not change the nature of thepayment being one of scholarship, nor does it matter whether the recipient is anIndian or a foreigner [CIT v V.K.

Grosstotal income minus deductions allowed under sections 80C to 80U is known as TotalIncome or Taxable Income which is rounded off to the nearest multiple of ten rupees.\nWhy is the classification done into different heads of income?.\n4,2\nAns,Although there is only one tax on the income calculated under various heads, but,there are different rules of computation of income under each head and income has tobe computed under that head after applying such rules only.\nIncome under each head hasto be determined in the manner provided by theappropriate sections mentioned against each head above [CIT v Dr Ramesh LalPahwa (1980) 123 ITR 86 (Cal)]. \n214A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nIf there is an income which cannot be brought to tax by computation under the aboveheads, it would not be included in the total income as defined in section 2(45) for thepurpose of chargeability [CIT v Justice R.M. Daita (1989) 180 ITR 86 (Cal)].\nThe computation of income under each the above five heads of income will have tobe made independently and separately. There are specific rules of deduction andallowance under each head. Nodeductionor adjustment on accountof anyexpenditure can be made except as provided by the Act [Tuticorin Alkali Chemicaland Fertilizers Ltd v CIT (1997) 227 ITR 172 (SC)).\n \nWhether an income falls under one head or another has to be decided according tocommon notions of practical men for the Act does not provide any guidance in thematter [Nalinikant Ambalal Mody v Narayan Row (S.A.L.) (1966) 61 ITR 596 (SC)].\n_The heads of income enumerated in section 14 are mutually exclusive, each headbeing specific to cover the item arising from a particular source. Thus, where anitems of income falls specifically under one head, it has to be changed under thathead and no other [United Commercial Bank Lid v CIT (1957) 32 ITR 688 (SC)].\nEven if such income arose in the course of assesses business, if the same falls clearlyunder some other head or satisfies, the test of any specific head, then such incomehas to be classified and computed only under such head [Tinsukia DevelopmentCorporation Ltd v CIT (1979) 120 ITR 466 (Cal)}.\nIt does not matter any way how the assessee has chosen to show a particular income\nin the return of income submitted by him. The incomeis to taxed under theappropriate head of income [Bihar State Co-operative Bank Lid v CIT (1960) 39 ITR114 (SC)}.

If this refationship doesnot exist, then the income would not be deemed to be income from salary. Therelation of employer and employee should be of master and servant. A master is onewho not only directs what and when a thing is to be done but how it is to be done,and the servant is one who is bound to carry out the instruction given to him by suchmasters.\nA payment received by an individual from a person other than an employer cannot betermed as salary. For example, commission received by a Director from a company\nis salary if the Director is an employee of the company. If the Director is not anemployee of the company, then the commission cannot be termed as salary andtherefore would not be taxable under the head \u201cSalaries\u201d. Commission in such a casewould be taxable either under the head \u201cIncome from Business or Profession\u201d orunder the head \u201cIncome from Other Sources\u201d. However, the Special Bench of theMumbai Tribunal in the case of Swmnit Bhattacharya v ACIT (2008) 300 ITR (AT)347 (Mum) held that amounts received by an assessee from the foreign holdingcompany of the assessee\u2019s employer company on redemption of stock appreciationrights, being \u201cfruits of employment\u201d, are chargeable to tax as \u201csalaries\u201d despite theabsence of an employer-employee relationship.\nIn other words, once the relationship of master and servant is established, anypayment by the employer or somebody on its behalf shall both be taxable under thehead \u201cSalaries\u201d.\nIf the payment of home salary abroad by the foreign company to the expatriate hasany connection or nexus with his rendition of service in India, then such paymentwould constitute income which is deemed to accrue or arise to the recipient in India \nComputation of Total Income225 \nas salary earned in India in terms of section 9(1)(ii} of the Act. [CITv Eli Lilly andCo. (India) Pvt, Ltd. (2009) 312 ITR 225 (SC)]\nWhether there is a relationship of employer and employee is a question of fact to bedecided on all the circumstances of the case. If it is found that there was no elementof employer-employee relationship, the income is assessable under the head \u201cIncomefrom Other Sources\u201d. The greater the amount of direct control exercised over theperson rendering the services by the person contracting for them, the stronger thegrounds for holding it to be a contract of service and similarly the greater the degreeof independence of such control the greater the probability that the services renderedare of the nature of professional services and that the contract is not one of service.At the same time, the right to control the manner of work is not the exclusive test fordetermining the relationship of employer and employee. The servant has as such nodiscretion of his own in carrying out of the instruction except such minor discretion\nas may be left to him by his master. In short, in all cases, the correct method ofapproach is whether having regard to the nature of work, there is due control andsupervision by the employer. [C/T v Lakshmipati Singhania (1973) 92 ITR 598(AlD]\nFor example, in the case of a lecturer of a college who is also appointed warden ofthe college and gets wardenship allowance, the allowance would be taxed under the.head \u201cSalaries\u201d because it is being received from the employer by the employee,although for non-academic work. However, if this lecturer sets the Question Paper of\na university, the remuneration which he receives for setting the paper will not betaxable under the head \u201cSalaries\u201d as the university is not the employer of the lecturer.Such remuneration would, however, be taxable under the head \u201cIncome from Other\u2014Sources\u201d,",

        "content": "4.14What is the difference between the relationship of a master and a servant asopposed to principal and agent?\nAns.The relationship of master and servant distinctly differs from that of principal andagent. Its distinction may be summed up as follows:\n\u2014a master is one who not only prescribes to the servant the end of his work butdirects or at any moment may direct the means also, or as it has been put, retainsthe power of controlling the work; a servant is a person subject to the commandof his master as to the manner in which he shall do his work.\n\u2014An independent contractor, on the other hand, is one who undertakes to produce\na given result, but so that in the actual execution of the work he is not under theorder and control of the person for whom he does it and may use his owndiscretion in things not specified beforehand.\n\u2014The test of distinction between a servant and an independent contractor is theexistence of a right of control over the agent in respect of the manner in which\nhis work is to be done. A servant is an agent, who works under the supervisionand direction of his employer; and an independent contractor is one who is hisown. master. A servant is a person engaged to obey his employer's orders fromtime to time, and an independent contractor is a person engaged to do certainwork, but to \u00e9xercise his own discretion as to the mode and time of doing it. He\nis bound by his contract, but not by his employer's order.\nIn short, whereas the principal has the right to direct, what work the agent has to do,\nthe master has the further night to direct, how the work is to be done, even in itsdetails. Every servant is an employee; but an agent may or may not be an employee[Lakshminarayan Ram Gopal & Son Lid v Govt. of Hyderabad (1954) 25 ITR 449\n(SC)].\nThe above test however is not universal in its application. There are many contractsof service where the master cannot control the manner in which the work is to bedone, as in the case of a captain of a ship, a chauffeur or a reporter of a newspaper.Obviously, the nature or extent of the control which is requisite to establish therelationship of employer and employee would vary from business to business and isincapable of precise definition. Speaking generally, however, the indicia of a contractof service may be summed by as follows:\n(i)the master's power of selection of the servant;\n(ii) the payment of wages or other remuneration;\n(ii) the master's right to control the method of doing the work; and\n(iv) the master's right of suspension or dismissal. \nComputation of Total Income227\nThere is a clear distinction between a contract for service and a contract of service. In\na contract for service, the master can order or require only what is to be dorie, while\nin the case of contract of service, he can not only order or require what is to be donebut also how itself it shall be done. A contract for service implies a contract wherebyone part undertakes to render service eg professional or technical service to or foranother in the performance of which he is not subject to detailed direction andcontrol but exercises professional or technical skill and uses his own knowledge anddiscretion. A contract of service implies relationship of master and servant andinvolves an obligation to obey orders in the work to be performed and as to its modeand manner of performance [indian Medical Association v Shantha (V.V.P.) (1995) 6SCC 651 (SC)].\nWhen it turns out on investigation that the relationship between the parties is that of\na principal and agent, the remuneration awarded to the agent is the one falling forcharge under the head Profits or gains of business, and not under the head Incomefrom salaries [Dharangadhra Chemical Works Ltd v State of Saurashtra AIR 1957SC 264].\nWhere an institution engages honorary part-time teachers on contract basis to takeclasses, it was held that even though the agreement gives liberty to teachers to work\nfor or under any other person, institute or company and even specifies that suchteachers are not to avail benefits as are available to regular employees, that wouldnot be a limiting factor in ascertaining the relationship of master and servant betweenthe applicant and the teacher where he is expected to work and teach as per thesyllabi meaning that the MMB has control over the teacher both in regard to thework to be done and the manner in which it should be done [Max Muller Bhavan, In\nre (2004) 268 ITR 31 (AAR - Del].",

In eachcase depending upon the attending facis and circumstances, the terms and conditionsof the engagement, a finding can be arrived at as to whether there is a master-servant\nor an employer-employee relationship. It can be arrived at in case, where it is foundby the income-tax authorities that though there is not a regular process of recruitmentand appointment,the contract would indicate that the doctor/professional wasappointed as an employee and on a regular basis.\nThus where doctors were drawing fixed plus variable pay with written contracts andon verifying the terms and conditions, the Tribunal concluded that neither of thedoctors was entitled to provident fund or any terminal benefits and they were free tocarry on their private practice at their own clinic in or outside hospitals but beyondthe hospital timings. It was held that all of these could be seen as indicators that theywere not employees but independent professionals. The amounts paid to them did notamount to salary. [CIT (TDS) v Grant Medical Foundation (Ruby Hall Clinic) (2015)375 ITR 49 (Borm)]\nWhere the terms of the contract ipso facto proved that the contract between theassessee-company and the doctors was of \u201ccontract for service\" not a \"contract ofservice\u201d as the remuneration paid to the doctors depended on the treatment of thepatients. Further, Consultancy charges were paid to the doctors towards renderingtheir professional skill and expertise which are purely in the nature of professionalcharges and the assessee-company had no control over the doctors engaged by them \nComputation of Total Income229 \nwith regard to treatment of patients, it was held that the non-competition clause in\nthe agreement would not invalidate the nature of the profession. It would not alter thenature of professional service rendered by the doctors. The Tribunal also found thatnone of the doctors were entitled to gratuity, provident fund, leave travel allowance\nor other terminal benefits. The doctors had filed their returns of income for therelevant assessment years showing the income received from the assessee-company\nas professional income and this had been accepted by the Department. Thus suchincome is a professional income and not taxable under the head salary. [C/T vManipal health Systems P. Ltd. (2015) 375 ITR. 509: 231 Taxman 518: 279 CTR 153(Karn)]",

It is however immaterial that for thispurpose the tax is paid under a contract or voluntarily by the employer according tocustom. If the employer pays without a contract, the tax paid by him would form aperquisite or an emolument of the office within the meaning of section 17(2)(iv) andwould be chargeable under this head.If, on the other hand, taxis paid under acontract of employment, the very contract would constitute remuneration at a highersalary thanis represented by the actual sum received by the employee [Datar(RBDD) v CIT (1952) 21 ITR 558 (Nag)]. However, as per section 10(10CC) tax onnon-monetary perquisites paid by the employer shall be exempt in the hands of theemployee. Having regard to section 200 of the Companies Act, 1956, an Indiancompany cannot pay any salary which is tax free or which varies with the taxpayable by the employee. However, tax paid by company in contravention of section200 of the Companies Act would nevertheless be part of salary [SatyanarayanRungta v CIT (1978) 115.ITR 382 (Cal)].",

        "content": "4.31What is the basis for charging income under the head salaries?\nAns.As per section 15, the following income shall be chargeable to income-tax under thehead \u2018Salaries\u2019:\n(a)any salary due from an employer or a former employer to an assessee in theprevious year, whether paid in that previous year or not;\n(b)any salary paid or allowed to him in the previous year by or on behalf of anemployer or a former employer though not due in that previous year or before itbecame due to him;\n(c)any arrears of salary paid or allowed to him in the previous year by or on behalfof an employer or a former employer, if not charged to Income-tax in any earlierprevious year.\nA reading of clauses (a), () and (c) of section 15 would show that under clause (a)salary income is chargeable on due basis; whereas under clauses () and (c) salaryincome is chargeable on payment basis. For the purposes of section 15, section 17includes within the meaning of the expression \u2018salary\u2019 certain benefits or perquisites \n234A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nreceived by the employee from the employer. These are chargeable to tax when they\nare allowed by the employer. For the purposes of the discussion that follows, thebasis under which such allowances are charged to tax is referred to as \u2018allowancebasis\u2019.\n()Due basis.\u2014As explained above, salary income is chargeable to tax either on\u2018due basis' or on \u2018payment basis\u2019 or, as it were, on \u2018allowance basis\u2019. Where thesalary has become due according to contract of service, it should be regarded asthe income of the previous year in which it becomes due, irrespective of whether\n \nit is paid or not [Bhuban Mohan Banerjee v CIT (1956) 29 ITR 229 (Cal)].\nWhere the salary is foregone voluntarily, a distinction has to be made betweenthe salary foregone before it becomes due and the salary surrendered after itbecomes due or accrues. In the former case, there is accrual of salary while in thelatter case it would be an application of the salary which has become due andpayable [CJT v Mehar Singh Sampuran Singh Chawla (1973) 90 ITR 219 (Del)].\n(2)Payment basis \u2014Asis explained above, under clauses (2) and (c) of section 15salary income is chargeable on payment basis. Clause (6) of section 15 applieswhere the salary is not due, but is paid in advance. Clause (c) on the other hand,applies to arrears of salary of past years paid in subsequent years provided thesame had not been charged as income of the relevant past year or years. Thiskind of things may happen when services are rendered in past years but thequantum of payment to be made is not determined till a later year when on suchdetermination payment is to be made to the employee or where emoluments arerevised with retrospective effect for a past year or years. Clause (c) wili alsoapply when unpaid salary though due in past year or years was not assessed forany reason whatsoever; it would then become assessable when paid under clause\n{c)...\n(3)No option to choose the basis of charge \u2014There is no option to the assessee oreven to the Assessing Officer to choose the basis of charge [Chuban MohanBanerjee y CIT (1956) 29 ITR 229 (Cal)].\n(4)Allowancebasis-\u2014Theword\u2018allowance\u2019hasreferencetosomeoftheperquisites under the head \u2018Salaries\u2019 which cannot appropriately be said to be\u2018due\u2019 or \u2018paid\u2019. Thus (a) a rent free accommodation provided to the employee, or\n(6)facility of watchman, gardener, sweeper or any other domestic servantprovided to the employee or (c) free education provided to employees of thechildren of the employee is neither \u2018due\u2019 or \u2018paid\u2019 but is certainly allowed. Again\nin respect of arrears of salary resulting from a retrospective sanction, the use ofthe word \u2018allowed\u2019 would be more appropriate than of the word \u2018due\u2019, before thearrears are actually paid.\nWhere any salary paid in advance is included in the total income of any person\nfor any previous year, it shall not be included again in the total income of theperson when the salary becomes due.\nAny salary, bonus, commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, due\nto or received by, a partner of a firm from the firm shall not be regarded as salaryfor the purpose of this section. The same shall be taxable under section 28. \nComputation of Total Income235 \nThe expression paid includes every receipt by the employee from the employerwhether it was due to him or not. The expression allowed is of wider connotationand any credit to the employee's account is covered, thereby and it should imply\nthat right is conferred on the employee in respect of the same [C/T v Russel\n(Z. W.) (1964) 53 ITR 91 (SC)].\nArrears of salary are taxable on payment basis and not on due basis [SardarArjun Singh Alhuwalia v CIT (1980) 124 ITR 347 (MP).\nAn employee is to be taxed on the salary income to which he is entitled toreceive during the relevant period. The reduction in his salary cannot be effectedwithretrospectiveeffect.Suchreductioncanoperateonly prospectively[Raghunathan (T.M.) v CIT (1998) 231 1TR 826 (Mad)].\nIf the salary is payable on monthly basis, it normally becomes due at the end ofthe month although it is paid in the next month. In this case, it will be taxable on\u2018due\u2019 basis because \u2018due\u2019 is earlier than \u2018receipt\u2019. Therefore, salary is normallytaxable from April to March as the salary of March becomes due at the end ofthe month. However, in some cases the salary becomes due on the 1st day of thenext month. In that case we shall tax the salary from March to February becausesalary of month of March of current year will be due only in the next financialyear and the salary of month of March of last previous year became due only on\n1st April of the current year.",

As per this section \u2018perquisite\u2019 includes:\n(i)the value of rent-free accommodation provided to the assessee by his employer;\n{ii}the value of any concession in the matter of rent respecting any accommodationprovided to the assessee by his employer;\n(iii)the value of any benefit or amenity granted or provided free of cost or atconcessional rate in any of the following cases: \nComputation of Total Income243 \n{a)by acompany to an employee, who is a director thereof;\n(b)by a company to an employee being a person who has a substantial interest\nin the company;,\n(c)by any employer (includinga company)to an employee to whom theprovisions of clause (a) and (8) do not apply and whose income under thehead Salaries (whether due from, or paid or allowed by, one or moreemployers), exclusive of the value of all benefits or amenities not provided\nfor by way of monetary payment, exceeds 250,000.\n(iv)any sum paid by the employer in respect of any obligation which, but for suchpayment, would have been payable by the assessee;\n{v)any sum payable by the employer whether directly or through a fund, other than\na recognised provident fund or an approved superannuation fund or deposit-linked insurance fund, to effect an assurance on the life of the assessee or to\neffect a contract for an annuity; and\n(vi)The value of any specified security or sweat equity shares allowed or transferreddirectly or indirectly by the employer or former employer free of cost or atconcessional rate to the assessee;\n(vii)The amount of any contribution to an approved superannuation fund by theemployer in respect of the assessee to the extent it exceeds 1,50,000; and\nAmendment made by the Finance Act, 2020\nRationalizationof tax treatmentof employer's contributionto recognizedprovident funds, superannuation funds and national pension scheme [Section17(2)] [W.e.f. A.Y. 2021-22]\nUnder the existing provisions of the Act, the contribution by the employer to theaccount of an employee in a recognized provident fund exceeding 12% of salary istaxable. Further, the amount of any contribution to an approved superannuation fundby the employer exceeding %1,50,000 is treated as perquisite in the hands of theemployee. Similarly, the assessee is allowed a deduction under National PensionScheme (NPS) for the 14% of the salary contributed by the Central Government and10% of the salary contributed by any other employer. However, there is no combinedupper limit for the purpose of deduction on the amount of contribution made by theemployer. This is giving undue benefit to employees earning high salary income.While an employee with low salary income is not able to let employer contribute alarge part of his salary to all these three funds, employees with high salary income\nare able to design their salary package in a manner where a large part of their salary\nis paid by the employer in these three funds. Thus, this portion of salary does notsuffer taxation at any point of time, since Exempt-Exempt-Exempt (EEE) regime isfollowed for these three funds. Thus, not having a combined upper cap is iniquitousand hence, not desirable.\nAmendment made\nTherefore, the Finance Act, 2020, w.e.f. A.\u00a5. 2021-22, has substituted the abovesub-clauses (vii) under section 17(2) by the following so that perquisite shall include: \n244A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\n(vii)the amount or the aggregate of amounts of any contribution made to the accountof the assessee by the employer\u2014\n(a}in a recognised provident fund;\n(b)in the scheme referred to in sub-section (7) of section 80CCD; and\n(c}in an approved superannuation fund,\nto the extent it exceeds %7,50,000 in a previous year; \n Thus,a combined upper limit of exemption of %7,50,000in respect ofemployer's contribution in a year to NPS, superannuation fund and recognisedprovident fund has been provided and any excess contribution shall be taxabie\n \nas perquisite.;\nFurther,the following sub-clause (viia) under section17(2)(relatingtoinclusive definition of perquisite) has been inserted, w.e.f. 2021-22 so as toprovide that perquisite shall include\u2014\n(viia)the annual accretion by way of interest, dividend or any other amount of similarnature during the previous year to the balance at the credit of the fund or schemereferred toin section 17(2)(viz)to the extentit relates to the contributionreferred to in the said sub-clause which is included in total income under the said\n_ Sub-clause in any previous year computed in such manner as may be prescribed. \nThus, any annual accretion by way of interest, dividend or any other amountof similar nature during the previous year to the balance at the credit of thefund or scheme may be treated as perquisite to the extent it relates to theemployer's contribution which is included in total income. \n(viti)The value of any other fringe benefit or amenity as may be prescribed.\n451An employeetakes unauthorised advantage withoutthe authorityof theemployer. Will it be taxable as perquisite in the hands of the employee?\nAns.- In order to be taxable as income, the benefit should have been authorised by theemployer. It must have a legal origin. Any unauthorised advantage taken by theemployee (like clandestine use of employer's car by the employee) without theauthority of the employer would only createa legal obligationto restore suchadvantage and therefore such an unauthorised advantage will not amount to a benefit\nor advantage within the meaning of section 17(2)(ii) [CIT v C. Kulandaivelu Konar(1975) 100 ITR 629 (Mad)].\nSimilarly, where a employee has been terminated from the service but he continues\nto occupy the house without the permission of the employer for 4 months after whichhe is evicted by the employer then such unauthorized occupation of the house cannotbe considered as perquisite and be charged to salary as the relationship of employerand employee ceased to exist on the date of termination. However, the value of suchbenefit enjoyed by such former employee shall be taxable under the head Incomefrom Other Sources in the hands of the former employee as the definition of incomegiven under section 2(24) is wide enough to include the value of such benefit. \nComputation of Total Income245\n4,52An employer pays premium for personal accident insurance policy of theemployee voluntarily to cover the contingency of paying compensation forinjuries or death. Will it be taxable as perquisite in the hands of the employee?\nAns,Where a personal accident insurance policy was not voluntarily taken by the assesseehimself but the same was taken by the employer-company in order to meet thecontingency of paying compensation for injuries or death, it was held, that premiumpaid by the employer-company towards such policy was not assessable in the handsof the assessee-employee as perquisite because it could not be said that the assesseehad any vested right in the premium amount which the employer-company waspaying in respect the policy [C/T v Lala Shri Dhar (1972) 84 ITR 192 (el)].\n4,53If any benefitor amenityis granted or providedtothe employeeataconcessional rate or free as provided in clause (iii) of section 17(2), will it betaxable as perquisite if the employee actually uses this facility?\nAns.The above perquisite will be taxable in the previous year in which these were\u2018provided\u2019 by the employer to the employee. Once such facility is provided by theemployer to the employee, it will be taxable and it will be immaterial whether theemployee actually uses this facility or not unless he has foregone or waived his rightsthereto [C7T v Bawa Singh Chauhan (1984) 150 ITR 8 (Del)].",

But sometimes the employer,insteadof makingthe paymentinrespectof such monetaryobligationsorreimbursing such amount to the employee, provides the perquisite in the form of afacilitytothe employee. Such facility will bea perquisite only for specifiedemployees mentioned in section 17(2){iii). For example, if a watchman/sweeper isengaged by the employee and his wages are reimbursed/paid by the employer, it is aperquisite for all employees because it is the duty of the employee to pay the salaryof his watchman/sweeper. On the other hand, if the watchman/ sweeper is engagedby the employer and facility of his services is provided to the employee, it will be aperquisite only for specified employees.\nAny benefit/amenity in the form of a facility (other than rent free accommodation,concession in the matter of rent or fringe benefits or amenities as may be prescribed)provided by the employer, which is not tax-free, shall be taxable only in the hands ofspecified employees. Some of these are:,\n(8)services of a sweeper, gardener, watchman or personal attendant,\n(ii)freeor concessional use of gas,electric energy and water for householdconsumption,\n(iii). free or concessional educational facilities,\n(iv)use of motor car,\n(v)personal or private journey provided free of cost or at concessional rate to anemployee or member of his household.\n4,57\u2018Who is a specified employee for purpose of section 17(2)(\u00e9ii)?\nAns.An employee shall be a specified employee, if he falls under any of the followingthree categories:\n(i)he is a Director of a company; or \nComputation of Total Income.247 \n(ii)he, ie the employee, has a substantial interest in the company. As per section\n2(32), person who has a substantial interest in the company, in relation to acompany meats a person who is the beneficial owner of shares, not being sharesentitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether with or without a right to participate\nin profits, carrying not less than 20% of the voting power; Here the wordbeneficial owner is significant. It means that even if a person is not a registeredholder of shares in 2 company but has beneficial interest in such shares, he shailbe covered by this definition and conversely, even if a person is a registeredholders of shares but has no beneficial interest in such shares, he shail not becovered by this definition. Thus, the beneficial ownership is the criterion under\nthis definition:\nExample: Suppose R is an employee of X Ltd who is also registered shareholderof X Ltd as Karta of HUF of shares purchased with the funds of HUF. In this\ncase, R cannot be called a specified employee since he has no beneficial interest\nin the shares registered in his name.\n(iii)his income under the head \u2018Salaries\u2019 (whether due from, or paid or allowed by,one or more employers), exclusive of the value of all benefits or amenities notprovided for by way of monetary payment, exceeds 250,000. Income, for thispurpose, shall include all taxable monetary payments like basic salary, dearnessallowance, bonus, commission, taxable allowances/perquisites but shall notinclude the value of any non-monetary benefits/perquisites. The following are tobe deducted from salary for this purpose:\n(a)standard deduction to the maximum extent of %50,000 (240,000 for A.Y.2019-20) [Section 16(ia)]\n(6)entertainment allowance [to the extent deductible under section 16(zi)];\n(c)tax on employment [Section 16(iii)].",

As the namesuggests, these payments are received by the employee in lieu of or in addition tosalary or wages. These payments include the following:\n(1)Terminal Compensation: The amount of any compensation due to or received byan assessee from his employer or former employer at or in connection with the \nComputation of Total Income-273 \ntermination of his employment or the modification of the terms and conditionsrelating thereto is regarded as profits in lieu of salary. The termination may bedue to retirement, premature termination and resignation or otherwise.\n(2)Paymentfromanunrecognisedprovidentfundoranunrecognizedsuperannuation fund: The next category of such profit in lieu of salary is,payment due to or received by an assessee from an unrecognised provident fund\nor an unrecognised superannuation find to the extent to which such paymentdoes not consist of contributions by the employee or interest on such employee'scontribution. In other words, total employer's contribution till date and intereston such employer's contribution would both be taxable. The accumulatedbalance of an unrecognised provident fund and unrecognised superannuationfund, consists of the employee's own contribution plus interest thereon and theemployer\u2019s contribution plusinterest thereon. Employer'scontributionandinterest thereon and interest on the employee's contribution are not taxed duringthe period of employment. When the accumulated balance of such a fund is paid\nto the employee either on retirement or on termination of service, the untaxedportion, ie the employer's contribution and interest thereon is taxed as \u2018profit inlie of salary\u2019. The interest on employee's contribution is taxed as \u2018Income fromother sources\u2019 [CIT v G. Hyatt (1971) 80 ITR 177 (SC)}.\n(3)Payment under Keyman Insurance Policy: Any payment due to or received by anemployee, under a Keyman Insurance Policy including the sum allocated by way\nof bonus on such policy, will also be regarded as profit in lieu of salary.\n(4)Any amount due or received before joining or after cessation of employment:Any amounts due to or received, whether in lump sum or otherwise by anyassessee from any person\u2014\n(A)before his joining any employment with that person; or\n(B)after cessation of his employment with that person.\noy)Any other sum received by the employee from the employer: All other paymentsmade by an employer to an employee, would be brought under the head \u2018Profits\nin lieu of salary\u2019. Thisis a comprehensive provision by virtue of which allpayments made by an employer to an employee whether made in pursuance of alegal obligation or voluntarily are brought under profit in lieu of salary.\nHowever, the following receipts, will not be termed as 'profits in lieu of salary' to theextent they are exempt under section 10.\n(i)Death-cum-retirement gratuity \u2014 Section 10(10)\n(i)Commuted value of pension \u2014 Section 10(10A)\nii)Retrenchment compensation received by a workman \u2014- Section 10(10B)\n(i)Payment received from a statutory provident fund \u2014 Section 10(11)\n1)Payment received from recognised provident fund \u2014 Section 10(12)\n(vi)Any payment from an approved superannuation fund as per section 10(13)\n(vii)House rent allowance exempt under section 10(13A) \n274A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nIn short, except for the terminal and other payments specifically exempted underclauses (10) to (13A) of section 10, ail other payments received by an employee from\nan employer or former employer are liable to tax under this head.\n4,101What is the treatment of an amount received by an employee before joining orafter cession of employment?\nAns.Any amounts due to or received, whether in lump sum or otherwise by any assesseefrom any person\u2014\n(A)before his joining any employment with that person; or\n(B)after cessation of his employment with that person\nare taxable as profits in lieu of salary.\nNon-compete commission received by the employee for not competing with\u2018 theemployer is liable to be taxed under the inclusive definition of salary under section17 of the Act.

Is this claim allowable?\nPension received by an employee is taxable under the head salary but family pensionreceived by legal heir of the deceased employee is taxable in the hands of legal heirunder the head income from other sources as there is no employer or employeerelationship.\nIn the case of family pension, a standard deduction @ 33'/3 of such income or$15,000 whichever is less is allowed under section 57(1){ia).\nThe Explanation to section 57(1)(a) has however stated that \u2018family pension\u2019 for thepurpose of this clause means a regular monthly amount payable by the employer to aperson belonging to the family of an employee in the event of his death.\n4,130How would you tax income under the head salaries in case of resident and non-resident if thereis Double Taxation Avoidance agreement with the other\ncountry.\nAns.Provisions under Domestic Law\nAs per section 5 relating to scope of total income, in case of resident and ordinarilyresident, any income (including salary) which accrues or arises outside Indiaistaxable in India even if it is received outside India.

If\nthe salary is earned in India, that is, by dint of service rendered in India, it is deemed\nto accrue or arise in India, and is taxable, wheresoever the salary may happen to bepaid or stipulated to be paid by the service contract.\nPlace of Accrual of pension: Pension is earned by reason of service rendered. Hence,on principle, it accrues or arises at the same place as salary. Consequently, a pensionlike salary, though paid abroad, is chargeable if the pensioner had worked in India.\nIf the payment of home salary abroad by the foreign company to the expatriate hasany connection or nexus with his rendition of service in India, then such paymentwould constitute income which is deemed to accrue or arise to the recipient in India\nas salary earned in India in terms of section 9(1)(ii) of the Act [CIT v Eli Lilly andCo.

It is very much limited to a type definedby the language of the section ie buildings and lands appurtenant thereto [ChitporeGolabari Co. P. Lid v CIT (1971) 82 ITR 753 (Cal)].

Co. 31 NY 389)].\nAs a house, out house, garage or any other structure cannot be erected without theground on which it is to stand, the expression building includes, the fabric of which it\nis composed, the ground upon which its walls stand and the ground within thosewalls [D.G. Gouse & Co. v State of Kerala AIR 1980 SC 271, 278].\nBuilding may consist of mud walls; but it must be covered by a roof. A meresuperstructure dissociated fromthesite on whichit stands cannotin law beconsidered to be a building [U.H. lrani v Chidambaram Chettiar AIR 1953 Mad650).\nBuilding would include a garden wall, or a wall, enclosing or defining some portionof a field [Per James, V.C., Bowels v Law LR 9 Eq. 641].\nA courtyard enclosed by low walls on three sides only, is not a building: 84 IC 863:26 Cr LJ 383: AIR 1925 Lah 279(2). If the house is in ruins without doors or roof, itcannot be said to be a building [99 IC 376: AIR 1927 All 214}.\nThe existence of a roof is not always necessary for a structure to be regarded as abuilding. Residential buildings ordinarily have roofs but there can bea non-residential buiiding for which a roof is not necessary [Ghanshiam Das v Devi PrasadAIR 1966 SC 1998, 1999].\nThe existence of a roof is not necessary for a structure to be classed as a building.But it does not follow that every roofless structure is a building. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Income from House Property\u2019295 \nA brick kiln having no walls and roof but a mere pit dug in the grounds with bricks,by its side, is not a building [Ghanshiram Das v Debi Prasad AIR 1966 SC 1998,2000].\nThe roads laid within the factory premises as links or provided approach to thebuildings are necessary adjuncts to the factory buildings to carry on the businessactivity would be building within the meaning of section 32 [Commissioner ofIncome Tax, Bombay v Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing Co, Ltd ATR 1992 SC1782, 1788].\nWhether a premise is a building or not depends upon the nature of the structure andnot the nature of the business carried on [Hiralalvy New Delhi Municipality AIR1967 Del 24, 25].\n55Will erection of a fence or a boundary wall constitute building?\nAns.The erection of a mere fence or boundary wall is not a building. But where such awall is built so as to enable the occupier of the main house to use the enclosed area aspart of his habitation and not merely as a boundary or fence, it comes within thedefinition of building[V.

But if the fundswere provided by way of repayable loan, then it shall be taxable in the hands of theborrower.\n \nWhere a house property consisting of seven flats is constructed out of the funds of afirm but by debiting it to the accounts of its seven partners, it was held that each oneof the partners was the owner of a flat assigned to him [C/T v Jetta Lal Nanji & Bres(1987) 167 ITR 191 (AP).\u00b0\nOwner in certain special cases\n(1)In case of mortgage of property, mortgagor of property is alone charged to taxunder section 22.\n(2)Where the property is owned by an association of persons, the AOP (Not themembers) shall be liable to tax under section 22.\n(3)Where the propertyis owned by parmership firm,itis the firm whichischargeable to tax under section 22.

The purpose for which the building,\netc is being used is not material [C/T v Kanai- yalal Mimani (1979) 120 ITR 892(Cal)]. Thus house property may be let by the assessee for residential purposes or forany commercial purpose. The income derived from letting out of such houseproperty will always be taxable under this head. Even if it is the business of theassessee to own and give houses on rent or to trade in houses, the annual value of thehouses owned by him during the previous year would be taxable as \u2018Income fromhouse property\u2019. The annual value of house property, though belonging to a business,must be charged under this head and not under section 28, if the property is not usedby the assessee for the purposes of his business. It will remain so even if property isheld by the assessee as stock in trade of a business. House owning, howeverprofitable, is neither trade nor business for the purpose of the Act.\nWhere the assessee leased out its building to a nursing home and showed rentalreceipt from building as business income, it was held that building which was leasedout by assessee was nothing else but a building simplicitor and was not a building,which was equipped with specialized plant and machinery and as such incomederived by assessee was from ownership of building and not from personal exertion.Hence income derived by assessee from leasing out of its property was an incomefrom house property and not a business income.

[RayalaCorporation Pyt. Lid. vy ACIT (2046) 386 ITR 500 (SC)]\n(i)Before dealing with the respective contentions, we may state, in a summaryform, schemeof the Act about the computation of the total income. Section 4 of\nthe Act is the charging Section as per which the total income of an assessee,subject to statutory exemptions, is chargeable to tax. Section 14 of the Actenumerates five heads of income for the purpose of charge of income tax andcomputation of total income. These are: Salaries, Income from house property,Profits and gains of business or profession, Capital gains and Income from othersources. A particular income, therefore, has to be classified in one of theaforesaid heads. It is on that basis rules for computing income and permissibledeductions which are contained in different provisions of the Act for each of theaforesaid heads, are to be applied. For example, provisions for computing theincome from house property are contained in Sections 22 to 27 of the Act andprofits and gains of business or profession are to be computed as per theprovisions contained in Sections 28 to 44DB of the Act. It is also to be borne inmind that income tax is only One Tax which is levied on the sum total of theincome classified and chargeable under the various heads. It is not a collectionof distinct taxes levied separately on each head of the income.\n(ii) There may be instances where a particular income may appear to fall in morethan one head. These kind of cases of overlapping have frequently arisen underthe two heads with which we are concerned in the instant case as well, namely,income from the house property on the one hand and profits and gains frombusiness on the other hand. On the facts of a particular case, income has to beeither treated as income from the house property or as the business income.Tests which are to be applied for determining the real nature of income are laiddown in judicial decisions, on the interpretation of the provisions of these twoheads, Wherever there is an income from leasing out of premises and collecting\nrent, normally such an income is to be treated as income from house property, \nIncome under the Head 'Income from House Property\u2019303 \nin case provisions of Section 22 of the Act are satisfied with primary ingredientthat the assessee is the owner of the said building or lands appurtenant thereto.Section 22 of the Act makes \u2018annual value\u2019of such a property as incomechargeable to tax under this head. How annual value is to be determined isprovided in Section 23 of the Act. \u2018Owner of the house property\u2019 is defined inSection 27 of the Act which includes certain situations where a person notactually the owner shall be treated as deemed owner of a building or partthereof. In the present case, the appellant is held to be \u201cdeemed owner\u201d of theproperty in question by virtue of Section 27(iiib) of the Act. On the other hand,under certain circumstances, where the income may have been derived fromletting out of the premises, it can still be treated as business income if lettingout of the premises itself is the business of the assessee.\n(iii)\nWhat is the test which has to be applied to determine whether the income wouldbe chargeable under the head \u201cincome from the house property\u201d or it would bechargeable under the head \u201cProfits and gains from business or profession\u201d, is\nthe question. Jt may be mentioned, in the first instance, that merely becausethere is an entry in the object clause of the business showing a particular object,would not be the determinative factor to arrive at a conclusion that the income\nis to be treated as income from business. Such a question would depend upon\nthe circumstances of each case. It is so held by the Constitution Bench of thisCourt in Sultan Bros. (P) Ltd. v CIT (1964) 5 SCR 807\n(iv)In view thereof, the object clause, as contained in the partnership deed, wouldnot be the conclusive factor. Matter has to be examined on the facts of each case\nas held in Sultan Bros. (P) Ltd. case. Even otherwise, the object clause which iscontained in the partnership firm is to take the premises on rent and to sub-let.\nIn the present case, reading of the object clause would bring out two discernible\nfacts, which are as follows:\n(a)The appellant which is a partnership firm is to take the premises on rentand to sub-let those premises. Thus, the business activity is of taking thepremises on rent and sub-letting them. In the instant case, by legal fictioncontained in Section 27(iiib) of the Act, the appellant is treated as \u201cdeemedowner\u201d.\n(b}The aforesaid clause also mentions that partnership firm may take anyother business as may be mutually agreed upon by the partners.\n(v)In the instant case, therefore,it is to be seen as to whether the activity inquestion was in the nature of business by which it could be said that incomereceived by the appellant was to be treated as income from the business. Before\nus, apart from relying upon the aforesaid clause in the partnership deed to show\nits objective, the learned counsel for the appellant has not produced or referred\nto any material. The ITAT being the last forum insofar as factual determination\nis concerned, these findings have attained finality. In any case, as mentionedabove, the learned counsel for the appellant did not argue on this aspect and didnot make any efforts to show as to how the aforesaid findings were perverse. Itwas for the appellant to produce sufficient material on record to show that its \n304A Compendium of fssues on Income Tax\nentire income or substantial income was from letting out of the property whichwas the principal business activity of the appellant. No such effort was made.\n'(vi) However, the Supreme Court in the case of Raj Dadarkar & Associates vy ACIT\n(2017) 81 taxmann.com 193 (SC) held that reliance placed by the appellant onthe judgments of this Court in Chennai Properties & Investments Ltd 373 ITR\n_ 673 (SC) and Rayala Corporation (P) Ltd. would be of no avail. In ChennaiProperties & Investments Ltd. where one of us (Sikri, J.) was a part of theBench found that the entire income of the appellant was through letting out ofthe two properties it owned and there was no other income of the assessceexcept the income from letting out of the said properties, which was thebusiness of the assessee. On those facts, this Court came to the conclusion thatjudgment of this Court in Karanpura Development Co. Lid.vy CIT, (1962) 44ITR 362 was applicable and the judgment of this Court in East India Housingand Land Development Trust Ltd. v CIT (1961) 42 ITR 49 was held to bedistinguishable. In the present case, we find that situation is just the reverse. InRayala Corporation (P) Lid., fact situation was identical to the case of ChennaiProperties & Investments Lid. and for this reason, Rayala Corporation (P) Ltd.followedChennai Properties&InvestmentsLtd, whichisheldtobeinapplicable in the instant case.\n \nWhere the prime object is to let out property alongwith additional right of usingJurniture and fixtures, the income is chargeable under the head house properiy:Where the prime object of the assessee under the said agreement was to let outportion of said property to various occupants by giving them additional right of usingfurniture and fixtures and other common facilities for which rent was being paidmonth by month in addition to the security free advance covering the entire cost ofthe said immovable property, the income derived from the said property was anincome from property and not income from business,as the property was notexploited as business asset [Shambhu Investment (P.) Lid v CIT (2003) 263 ITR 143(SC)].However, the following are the exceptions to the above rule:\n(a)The annual value of the house property/portion of the house property which isused for purpose of the business or profession carried on by the assessee does not\nfall under this head, provided profits of such businessor professionarechargeable to income-tax.\nSection 22 specifically excludes from its scope portions or the entire property (i)which the owner may occupy for the purpose of any business or professioncarried on by him (ii) the profit of which are chargeable to tax. Both theseconditions must be fulfilled and then only the house property is taken out of theoperation of section 22. The term \u2018occupy\u2019 mentioned in this exception refers tothe occupation directly by the assessee or through an employee or an agent, butsuch occupation must be subservient to and necessary for the business of theassessee [CITv Modi Industries Ltd (1994) 210 ITR 1 (Del)(FB)].\n(b) Where the property is let out with the object of carrying on the business of theassessee in an efficient manner, then the rental income shall be taxable as \nIncome under the Head \u2018Income from House Property\u2019305 \nbusiness income (provided letting is not the main business but it is subservient/incidentalto the main business) because the letting out of the propertyisincidental to the main business of the assessee and in this case deductions/allowances would have to be calculated as relating to profits/ gains of businessand not as relating to house property.\nWhere the assessee gives certain quarters on rent to his employees and chargesrent from them then the rental income would be treated as business income andnot income from house property [C/T v Dethi Cloth & General Mills Co.

It has obtained a certificate of completion fromthe competent authority on 6.5.2020. In this case, the annual value of the houseproperty till 31.3.2023 shall be taken as nil if it has not been let at all till that date.However, w.e.f. 1.4.2023, the notional annual value will have to be computed if suchhouse property which is forming part of stock-in-trade was not let during the whole\nor any part of the previous year.\nIt may however be noted that the above sub-section (5) has been inserted in case thebuilding and the land appurtenant thereto is held as stock-in-trade.

Whether it is the one or the other must necessarily depend upon the objectwith which the act is done. When a company is formed with the specific object ofacquiring properties not with the view to leasing them as property but to selling them\nor turning them to account even by way of leasing them out as an integral part of itsbusiness, it cannot be said to treat them as landowner but as trader.

The AssessingOfficer rejected the claim of standard deduction on the ground that impugned receipttowards installation of antenna\" was taxable as \u201cincome from other sources\". Onappeal the CIT(A) upheld the order of AO on following basis:\nIt relied on judgment of High Court of Caicutta in case of Mukherjee State Pvt. Ltd vCIT [2000] 113 TAXMAN 313 (CAL.) wherein it was held that if rent was only forfixing the hoarding, it could not be treated as part of the building, nor it could betreated as land appurtenant thereto. Therefore such income be separately considered\nas income from other sources. On the same analogy the CIT(A) held that rent frominstallation of mobile antennae erected on the top of the building would not betaxable under the head \u201cincome from house property\", as the same could not betreated as part of the building nor be treated as land appurtenant thereto. On appealthe Tribunal held as under\nThe relianceon judgment of Mukerjee Estates (Supra) was wholly misplaced,wherein the Tribunal had given a categorical finding that the assessee had let out thehoardings and not the roof of building. It was in this backdrop the High Court heldthat rent was taken as rent for hoardings per se rather than rights on the roof wherehoardings could be installed. Once the CIT(A) agreed that rent was only forproviding space for installation of mobile antennae, there was no occasion toconsider whether antenna would be a part of building or land appurtenant thereto asthe true test was whether such a space, rented out, was part of the building or landappurtenant thereto? What was relevant was the space which had been rented out \nincome under the Head 'Income from House Property\u2019313 \nand, therefore, as long as the space was part of the building, the rent was required tobe treated as \u201cincome from house property\".

        "content": "5.29What are the factors which are taken into consideration in determining theannual value of a property?\nAns.In determining the annual value there are four factors which are normally taken intoconsideration. These are:\ni)Actual rent received or receivable\nActual rent received/receivable is an important factor in determining the annualvalue of a property though this is not the only decisive factor. The actual rentcould be dependent upon various considerations. There could be circumstanceswhere the owner agrees to bear certain obligations of the tenant eg the water andelectricity bills of the tenant may be payable by the owner. In this case, the deFacto rent will be calculated by stepping down the rent received/receivable by theamount spent by the owner on meeting the obligation of the tenant. On the other\n'hand, if any obligation of the owner is met by the tenant, the de facto rent will be\ncomputed by stepping up the rent received/receivable by the amount spent by thetenant in discharging the obligation of the landlord.\nIt may, however, be observed that the municipal taxes of the house property are\nto be borne by the occupier who in the case of let out property is the tenant.Therefore, if such municipal taxes are bome by the tenant the rent received/receivable should not be stepped up to calculate de facto rent [CIT v GillandersArbuthnot and Co Ltd (1983) 142 ITR 598 (Cal)].\nFurther where repair expenses are contractually borne by the tenant, the rentreceived/receivable should not be stepped up to calculate de facto rent [CIT vParbutty Churn Law (1996) 57 ITR 609 (Cal)].\nWhere assessee had paid society maintenance charges which was obligation oflessee and same was included in rent received by assessee, deduction undersection 23 was allowable in respect of such charges. [Asha Ashar v ITO (2017)$1 taxmann.com 441 (Mumbai - Trib.): (2016) 46 ITR(T) 492 (Mumbai - Trib.)]\n(ii)Municipal value: This is the value as determined by the municipal authorities forlevying municipal taxes on house property. Municipal authorities normallycharge house tax/municipal taxes on the basis of annual letting value of suchhouse property, which is determined by it based upon many considerations,\n(iti)Fair rent of the property: Fair rent is the rent which a similar property can fetch\nin the same or similar locality, if it is let for a year.\n(iv)Standard rent: The standard rent is fixed under the Rent Control Act. If thestandard rent has been fixed for any property under the Rent Control Act, theowner cannot be expected to get a rent higher than the standard rent fixed underthe Rent Control Act. Therefore, this is also an important factor in determiningthe annual value.;\nAt the time of determining Annual Letting Value of properties, which are subject toRent Control Act, it is the duty of AO to determine standard rent if it isn't fixedunder Rent Control Legislation [Smt.

Further while determining the actual rent, no notional-interest on such deposit should be considered. The Delhi High Court in C77 v AsianHotels Ltd (2008) 168 Taxman 59 (Del) held that in the absence of any specificprovision similar to one under the Wealth Tax Act, 1957, it is not permissible toconsider notional interest as income either under section 23 or as one which ischargeable under section 28(v).\nSection 23(1){a) requires determination of the \"fair rent\" being \u201cthe sum for whichthe property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year\". If on inquiryAssessing Officer finds that the actual rent received is less than the \"fair/market rent\"because the assessee has received abnomnally high interest free security deposit, hecan undertake necessaryexerciseinthat behalf.However,by nostretchofimagination, the notional interest on the interest free security can be taken asdeterminative factor to arrive at the \u201cfair rent\". The ALV fixed by the MunicipalAuthorities can be the basis of adopting the ALV for purposes of section 23.

Such rent is known as composite rent. The said compositerent can fali under 2 categories:\n(a)composite rent on account of rent for the property and service charges forvarious facilities provided alongwith the house like lift, gas, water, electricity,watch and ward, air conditioning etc In this case such composite rent should be\nsplit up and the portion of rent attributable to the letting of the premises shall beassessable as \u201cIncome from House Property\". The other portion of the compositerent received for rendering services shall be assessable as \"Income from OtherSources\" [CIT v Kanak Investments P. Ltd (1974) 95 ITR 419 (Cal)]. However inKarnani Properties Lid v CIT (1971) 82 ITR 547 (SC) on the facts found by theTribunal, it was held that similar service rendered by the assessee to its tenantswere the result of its activities carried on continuously in an organised manner,with a set purpose and with a view to earning profits. Hence, those activitieswere business activities and taxable under section 28.\n(6)composite rent on account of rent for the property and the hire charges ofmachinery, plant or furniture belonging to the owner. In this case if the letting ofthe property is separable from the letting of the other assets, then the portion of\n-the rent attributable to the letting of the premises shall be assessable as \"Incomefrom House Property\" and the other portion of the composite rent for lettingother assets shall be assessable either as \u201cProfits and Gains of Business orProfession\" or \"Income from Other Sources\u201d. On the other hand, if the letting of\nthe propertyis inseparable from the letting of other assets like machinery,furniture, the entire income would be taxable as \"Profits and Gains of Business\nor Profession\u201d or \"Income from Other Sources\".\nIncome from shopping complex held to be partly business income and partly incomefrom house property if the rent received is not composite rent: Ownership of propertyand leasing it out may be done as a part of business, or it may be done as a landowner. Whether it is the one or the other must necessarily depend upon the objectwith which the act is done. When a company is formed with the specific object ofacquiring properties not with the view to leasing them as property but to selling them\nor turning them to account even by way of leasing them out as an integral part of itsbusiness,it cannot be said to treat them as landowner but as trader. In decidingwhether a company dealt with its properties as owner, one must see not the form \nIncome under the Head \u2018Income from House Property\u2019319 \nwhich it gave to the transaction but the substance of the matter. The assessee was acompany formed with the object of erecting shopping complexes, houses, buildingsand sell, lease, let out, mortgage or otherwise dispose of the shopping complexes andhouses built.

If the actual rent so received or receivable as per clause\n(6) is more than the reasonable expected rent computed as per clause (a), the GrossAnnual Value shall be the actual rent so received or receivable. On the other hand ifthe actual rent so received or receivabie is less than the expected rent then the GrossAnnual Value shall be expected rent so computed.\nAs per clause (a) above, the first step for determination of gross annual value is tocalculate the sum for which the property might reasonably be expected to let fromyear to year.

Ambaniv CIT (2014) 49taxmann.com 371 (Bom)].\nHowever, the above decision is not significant if the property or part of the property\nis let and the actual rent received or receivable by the owner, in respect thereof is inexcess of the sum determined under section 23(1)(a) above, as in that case, theannual value shail be taken to be the actual rent so received/receivable as per section23(1)(B).\nAlthough the expected rent as per section 23(1)(a) cannot exceed standard rent but itcan be lower than standard rent [Balbir Singh (Dr) v MCD (1985) 152 ITR 388(SC)].\nStep 2: Taxes levied by any local authority in respect of the property ie Municipaltaxes (including services taxes) to be deducted: Municipal taxes, etc levied by localauthority are to be deducted from the gross annual value calculated as above, if thefollowing conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)the municipal taxes have been bore by the owner, and\n(6)these have been actually paid during the previous year\nTherefore deduction for municipal taxes, etc levied by any local authority is allowed\nif they are borne and actually paid by the owner. It must be noted that the taxes areallowed as deduction only in the previous year in which these are paid. Municipaltaxes, ete due but not paid shall not be allowed as deduction. However, municipaltaxes, etc paid during the previous year are allowable even if they relate to past years_\nor future years.\nWhere cheque was issued in respect of Municipality tax before end of previous yearbutit was encashed subsequently,it was held that the assesseeis entitledtodeduction as cheque relates back to date of issue, [CIT v Punalur Paper Mills Ltd.(2019) 411 ITR 563 176 DTR 342: (2019) 309 CTR 42 (Ker)]\nEven where the propertyis situated outside the country, taxes levied by localauthority in that country are deductible in deciding the annual value of the property(CIT v R. Venugopala Reddiar (1965) 58 ITR 439 (Mad)].\nThe value arrived at after deducting the municipal taxes, if any, may be referred to asthe Net Annual Value (Annual value as per Income-tax Act). \nIncome under the Head \u2018Income from House Property\u201932]\nFrom such net annual value, deductions as permissible under section 24(a) and (5)are allowed and the balance is the income under the head \u2018Income from house\nproperty\u2019.What is the relevance of actual rent in determining the annual value of houseproperty?",

        "content": "5.37\nAns.Where the assessee leased its building to a firm consisting of his wife, daughter andtrusted employee at low rent and subsequently the firm sublet it at a higher rent, itwas held that, for the purpose of determining the annual value of the property, suchhigher rent shall be considered to bethe sum for which the property mightreasonably be expected to let from year to year [N. Natraj v DCIT (2004) 266 ITR277 (Mad)}.\nOn the other hand, where the property let to a tenant was sublet and agreementbetween the landlord and the tenant and tenant and sub-tenant was found to begenuine, the amount actually received by the assessee shall constitute the annualvalue of the property [CIT v Indra Co. Ltd (2004) 268 ITR 240 (Cal)].\nAs per section 23(1)(6), the actual rent received by the assessee would be thedetermining factor for assessment of the income from house property, on account of\nthe fact that such actual receipt is higher than the annual value determined under theMunicipal Act. If the property is let out to a tenant who sub-lets it and gets a higherrent, the same cannot be a determining factor for assessing annual value undersection 23(1) at the hands of the lessor, where the creation of the tenancy or the lease\nis found to be genuine. Any benefit or advantage derived from the interest-freeadvance by way of saving of interest or of earning interest or making profits byinvesting such deposit would be available in computing the income of the assesseeunder other heads. Such notional interest can never be added to the rent, in theabsence of any provision to this effect in section 22 or section 23 [C/T v HemrajMoahabir Prasad Ltd (2005) 279 ITR 522 (Cal)].\nWhere the department does not dispute that the rent which was agreed between theassessee and the tenant was not fair and reasonable rent at the time when the propertywas let out, such agreed rent must be taken as \u2018annual value\u2019 [CIT v Modi IndustriesLtd (No. 4) (1993) 200 ITR 350 (Del)].\nThere are many instances where owners of very huge properties in cities with rentcontrol legislation, receive very small amounts of rent, but if those huge propertieswere vacated, those would fetch annually a fortune and a wealth for the assessee. If\nthe notional value is taken as the irue and correct interpretation of section 23, thenthese owners of old rented property, would come under a very heavy tax incidence,without even having the income to pay it from. In considering the annual value of theproperty for any assessment year, that assessment year, as far as practicable, shouldbe taken in isolation, as if that assessment year stands by itself. The property which\nis already tenanted at the beginning of the assessment year, cannot be expected to letfrom year to year at any figure higher than the rent which is being produced actuallyby the property in question provided the rent agreement is genuine [C7T v Kishanlal& Sons (Udyog) Pvt. Ltd (2003) 260 ITR 481 (Cal)]. \n322A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nOrdinarily, a bargain between a willing lessor and a willing lessee uninfluenced byany extraneous circumstances may afford a guiding test of reasonableness. Aninflated or deflated rate of rent based upon fraud, emergency, relationship and suchother consideration may take it out of the bonds of reasonableness [Corporation ofCalcutta v Padma Debi AIR 1962 SC 151, 153].\n \nWhat the landlord might reasonably expect.to get from a hypothetical tenant, if thebuilding were let from year to year, affords the statutory yardstick for determiningthe annual value [Dewan Daulat Rai Kapoor v NDMC (1980) 122 ITR 700 (SC)].",

Clause (c) encompasses cases where aproperty is let out for more than a year in which event alone would the question of ifbeing vacant during the whole of the previous year arise. A property let out for two\nor more years can also be vacant for the whole of a previous year bringing it withinthe ambit of clause (c) of section 23({1) of the Act. [Vivek Jain v Asst. CIT (2011) 337ITR 74 {AP)} \nIncome under the Head 'Income from House Property\u2019323 \nALV of property remaining vacant for whole year has to be computed with reference\nto section 23(1)(c) and, therefore, where assessee intended to let property and tookappropriate efforts in letting property but ultimately failed to let the same, in terms ofsection 23(1)(c), its ALV had to be regarded as Nil. [Vikas Keshav Garud v ITO(2016) 71 taxmann.com 214 (Pune) (Trib)]\nAs long as a property is let in earlier period and is found vacant for whole year underconsideration, subject to condition that such vacancy of property is not for selfoccupation of same by assessee, ALV of said property would be determined undersection 23(1) (c). [Informed Technologies India Ltd. v DCIT-3(2), Mumbai (2016) 75taxmann.com 128 (Mum) (Trib)]\nWhere the High Court by impugned order held that annual value of properties whichwere more than one, owned by assessee and which admittedly remained vacantthroughout previous year would not be assessed under section 23(1)(c) but undersection 23(1}(a) and annual value would be determined notionally as done by lowerauthorities, a Special Leave Petition filed against impugned order was dismissed.{Susham Singla v CIT, Patiala (2017) 81 taxmann.com 167 (SC)/(2017) 247 Taxman312 (SC)]. In the instant case, the assessee had more than one house property ownedby him and no house property was let in the past years also and hence section 23(4)was applicable and the notional rent has to be determined as per section 23(1)(a).\nFrom the perusal of the above, the following two situations may emerge\nSitnation 1\nWhere the property is let and was vacant for part of the year and the actual rentreceived or receivable is more than the sum determined under clause (a) in spite ofvacancy period. (This situation falls under clause (2) above).\nSituation 2\nWhere the property is let and was vacant for whole or part of the year and the actualrent received or receivable owing to such vacancy is less than the sum determinedunder clause (a).

It is not essential to thecarrying on of a business that the people who carry it on should make a profit or eventhat they should desire or wish to do so. [Sarojini Rajah v CIT (1969) 71 ITR 504(Mad)].\nTo regard an activity as business, there must be a course of dealings continued orcontemplated to be continued with a profit motive and not for sport or pleasure[Bharat Development (P) Ltd v CIT (1982) 133 ITR 470 (Del)].\nWhere the assessee had been carrying on the activity of sale, lease and maintenanceof the horses in an organized manner, not only in the year in question but also inearlier and subsequent years, and had carried on the activity with a profit motive, theactivities of the assessee were business activities and there was a profit elementinvolved in the carrying on the activity. The income that arose from the lease andsale of horses was business income and the proceeds from sale of horses are notcovered under the head capital gains. Further, horses were not personal effects [A\u00e9rsKamla Muthia v CIT (2003) 259 ITR 184 (Mad)].\nCan a person do business with himself?\nBusiness is not a unilateral act. It is brought about by a transaction between two ormore persons. If there is an activity which is a business activity, and that activity iscarried on between two persons, then each is carrying on business with the other. It \n340A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nfollows from the above as a corollary that a man cannot do business with himself. InKikabhai Premchand (Sir) v CIT (1953) 24 ITR 506 (SC), the Supreme Court alsopointed out that it was unreal and artificial to separate the business from its ownerand treat them as if they were separate entities trading with each other and then bymeans of a fictional sale introduce a fictional profit which in truth and im fact wasnon-existent and that a man could not trade with himself nor could he make profit orloss out of transactions with himself.",

Each case will have to be examined on its own facts. The onlything to do is to look at the characteristics of a trade and see how the (present)transaction measures up to them.\nIt is only a concern in the nature of trade that falls within the definition of a business.A concer in the nature of trade implies that it has an adequate degree of businessorganisation for the purpose of carrying an undertaking. It involves direction ofmanagement as well as receipt of profits.\nWhat are the broad guiding features determining whether a transaction is anadventure or concern in nature of trade, commerce or manufacture?\nADS.Broad guiding features to determining whether the transaction is an adventure orconcern in the nature of trade, commerce or manufacture.\n(1) Not necessary to have a series of transaction: It is not necessary to constitutetrade that there should be a series of transactions, both of purchase and sale. A singletransactionof purchase andsale outsidethe assessee\u2019sline of business mayconstitute an adventure in the nature of trade. Neither repetition nor continuity of \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019341 \nsimilar transactions is necessary to constitute a transaction an adventure in the natureof trade.\n(2) Whether related to existing line of business: If a transaction is related to thebusiness which is normally carried on by the assessee, though not directly a pari of it,an intention to launch upon an adventure in the nature of trade may readily beinferred,\nIf, on the other hand, a person\u2019s usual business is in one particular line and helaunches out on something totally unrelated to the business and perhaps evenunfamiliar to him, the question whether it can be deseribed as an adventure in thenature of trade is more difficult to answer.\nThe principles underlying the distinction between a capital sale and an adventure inthe nature of trade were examined by the Supreme Court in Venkataswami Naidu &Co. (G) v CIT (41959) 35 ITR 594 (SC), where it was held that the character of atransaction cannot be determined solely on the application of any abstract rule,principle or test but must depend upon all the facts and circumstances of the case.Ultimately,it is a matter of first impression with the court whether a particulartransaction is in the nature of trade or not. It has been said that a single plunge maybe enough provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the plunge is made\nin the waters of the trade; but mere purchase or sale of shares if that is all that isinvolved in the piunge may fall short of anything in the nature of trade.\nAssessee entered into an agreement with \u2018J' for purchase of a plot of land and certainamount was paid as earnest money. However, possession of land was not given toassessee and seller entered into another agreement with a third party to develop saidplot. Assessee filed suit in which a consent decree was passed and in pursuance ofsame certain amount was paid to assessee. On appeal it was held that such sumreceived in pursuance of consent decree was liable to tax as business income undersection 28({iv) and not as capital gain in view of finding of fact recorded by Tribunalthat transaction of purchase of land was in nature of an adventure in trade. [RameshBabulal Shah v CIT (2015) 53 taxmann.com 277 (Bom)].\n(3) Intention to resell: If the assessee, at the time of acquisition of any article orcommodity had an intention to resell the same at a later date for profit, it may be agood case of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. But the Supreme Court\nin the case of Janki Ram Bhadur Ram v CIT (1965) 57 ITR 21 (SC) held that if theassessee, even at the time of acquisition had a clear intention to resell it, that wouldbe material but not a decisive consideration.\nWhere a purchase is made with the intention of resale, it depends upon the conductof the assessee and the circumstances of the case whether the venture is on capitalaccount or in the nature of trade. A transaction is not necessarily in the nature oftrade because the purchase was made with intention to resell [Radha Debi Jalan vCiT (1951) 20 ITR 176 (Cal)].\n(4) Magnitude of the transaction: Magnitude of the transaction of purchase, thenature of commodity, subsequent conduct of the assessee, the manner of disposal,\netc, are some of the considerations to be taken into account in deciding whether atransaction is an adventure in the nature of trade. \n342A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nConclusion\nThe decision in each case must rest on the totality of the facts and the combinedeffect of all the circumstances. The ultimate test is the dominant impression left onthe mind after all the factors and circumstances are taken into consideration and dueweight given to them.\nNot one of the considerations mentioned above is by itself really conclusive. The factthat the transaction begins with one purchase and ends with one sale is not decisive.\n \nIt may yet be in the nature of a trade. The transaction on the other hand may berepeated a second time and there might yet be no trade or adventure.",

This section does not state what profession means; it only states thatprofession will include vocation.\n\u2018The word Professionimplies professed attainmentinspecial knowledgeasdistinguished from mere skill. A profession involves labour, skill, education andspecial knowledge and implies a vocation requiring higher education and learning,intellectual skill as distinguished from one that used an occupation for the production\nor sale of commodities ...\u2019.\nProfession involves occupation requiring purely intellectual or manual skill [CZT vManmohan Das (1966) 59 ITR 699 (SC)].\nA vocation, as normally understood, is a calling in which a person passes his life. Itmay even be stated to be a way of living or a sphere of activity for which one has aspecial fitness, though it is not necessary that the activity should be indulged in forpurposes of livelihood [Ramaswami Gounder (K.) v CIT (1987) 163 ITR 94 (Mad)].\nIn order that an activity may be called a vocation, it need not be shown that it is anorganised activity and that it is indulged in with a profit-motive [Krishna Menon (P.)\nv CIT (1959) 35 ITR 48 (SC)].\nProfession is a word of wide import and includes \u2018vocation\u2019 which is only a way ofliving and a person can have more than one vocation and the vocation need not be forlivelihood nor for making any income nor need it involve systematic and organizedactivity. The mere fact that the teaching of Vedanta was a mater of religion wouldnot mean that the assessee was not carrying on a vocation. Giving of discourse onVedanta without any motive or intention of making profit out of such activity was avocation and the raising of the contributions for purchasing a car for the assessee byhis disciples was in consideration of teaching imparted by him [Addi/, CIT v RamKripal Tripathi (1980) 125 ITR 408 (Al).\nPolitics is a profession [CIT v Raju (P.V.G.)

Thus, ithas been held that where the court takes away the right of the owner to carry on hisown business and appoints somebody else to carry on the business, the owner willnot be assessable on the income of such profits [Saifudin Ali Mohamed v.CIT (1954)25 ITR 237 (Bom)].

It could not be inferred that the decision to lease theproduction units was motivated by a desire io derive income from the assets as amere owner thereof, A commercial asset does not cease to be commercial assetby reason merely of an intervening lull in the business during which the. asset isindirectly exploited commercially by leasing it to a third party in the trade. Thiswas the principle laid down in [CEPT v Shri Lakshmi Silk Mills Ltd (1951) 20ITR 451 (SC). See also CIT v Vikram Cotton Mills Ltd (1988) 169 ITR 597(SC)].\n(ii)In the case of Sultan Bros Pvt. Lid v CIT [(1964) 51 ITR 353 (SC)], the assesseehad a building constructed and equipped to be utilised as a hotel, but the assesseenever entered hotel business for the purpose of exploiting the said property as ahotelier. Instead, from the very outset, the assessee leased the hotel building to athird party enabling it to start hotel business. It was held that, in such a situation,the property, though specifically meant to be utilised as a hotel building was not\na commercial asset in the hands of the assessee as the assets never had anycommerce subsisting in the said asset. Assessees income from the lease wasincome arising from ownership simpliciter of an asset.\n(iii)The third case, ie New Savan Sugar and Gur Refining Co. Lid v CIT (1969) 74ITR 7 (SC) presented altogether a different situation. In that case, the assessee \n346A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nfound its business in shambles. Court held that this was a case where the act ofleasing was the outcome of the assessee\u2019s decision to get out of business. Thus,\nthe assessee ceased to be trader and the factory also shed its character as acommercial asset in the hands of the assessee. The factory became merely anasset of the assessee and the lease rent derived was the fruit of ownershipsimpliciter. The income could not be said to be derived from ownership of theasset by the assessee in the capacity of a trader. Therefore, in such a situation,the lease rent was assessable as Income from other sources.\nSimilarly, in case of house property, what has to be seen is whether the asset is beingexploited commercially by the letting out or whether it is being let out for thepurpose of enjoying the rent, The distinction between the two is a narrow one andhas to depend on certain facts peculiar to each case. Pure and simple commercialassets like machinery, plant, tools, industrial sheds or godowns having high businesspotentials stand on a different footing from assets like land or building.\nWhere the assessee had leased out its factory on rent and lease was a temporaryarrangement to tide over financial difficulties and there was no intention to part withthe factoryas commercialasset,the income was income from business[SriHannuman Sagar & Industries Ltd v CIT (2004) 266 ITR 106 (Guj)].\nSo long as assets are used as business assets, it is irrelevant whether the businessassets are exploited and used by the assessee itself or someone else. Where instead ofcarrying on the business itself, the assessee permits someone else to use the assetsand carry on the identical business, then the activity of the assessee will be judged as\na business activity and the income from such lease will not be taxed under the headother sources [CIT v G.V. Rattaiah & Co. (2001) 256 ITR 351 (AP)].\nWhen property was given on lease, assessee-company was declared as sick industrialunit and even rehabilitation scheme was under preparation and office premises wasleased out just to exploit assets for business purposes, it was held that lease rent had\nto be treated as business income of assessee. [C/T v Vallabh Glass Works Lid. (2013)218 Taxman 152 (Mag) (Guj) : (2013) 218 Taxman 152 (Mag) (Guj)).\nI.Where assessee closed down its business of manufacturing tiles during relevantyear and earned rental income by giving premises on lease, since main activity ofassessee was of letting out properties, it was held that rental income in questionwastobetaxedunderhead\u2018incomefrombusinessor profession\u2019andremuneration paid to directors for rendering services in order to earn said rentalincome was to be allowed as deduction.\nTI.Assessee had regularly dealt in purchase and sale of share which indicated periodof holding to be very short. There were several instances when assessee hadpurchased shares and sold them either same day or after a few days. In most ofcases, assessee had done intraday transactions. Where assessee was sellingshares very frequently, volume and magnitude was very high and he eared only\na small amount of dividend, income arising from sales of shares was held to beassessableasbusinessincome.[Rakesk Kumar GuptavCIT (2018)92taxmann.com 101 (Delhi)] \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019347 \nWhere agreements for letting out of specialised buildings in STP and provision ofcomprehensive services to IT industry entered into contemporaneously with object ofenjoying entire property as a whole, which was necessary for carrying on business,income could not be separated on basis of separate agreements,it was held thatincome from letting out was assessable as business income and not as income fromhouse property or income from other sources. [CIT v Velankani Information Systems\n(P.) Ltd. (2013) 218 Taxman 88 (Kar)].\nWhether where assessee had leased out its business assets and gave a special right orprivilege to franchisees to underiake a particular business in property of assessee onreceipt of franchisee fee, it was held that the income as franchisee fee was clearly innature of business income and not income from house property [Tamil Nadu TourismDevelopment Corpn. Lid.vy DCIT (2014) 51 taxmann.com 78 (Mad): (2014) 227Taxman 179 (Mad)(MAG.):(2014) 368 ITR 533 (Mad)].\nWhere assessee was in business of taking land, putting up commercial buildingsthereon and letting-out such building with all furniture, notwithstanding fact thatassessee had constructed building and also provided other facilities and there weretwo separate rental deeds, for two types of activities, income received by assesseewould not fall within heading of \u2018Income from House Property\u2019 andit wouldconstitute business income.[Black Pearl Hotels(P.) Lid.v DCIT (2015)54taxmann.com 20 (Kar) : (2015) 229 Taxman 155 (Kar)]\nThe assessee-company was incorporated with main objective,as statedintheMemorandum of Association, to acquire the properties in the city and to let out thoseproperties as well as make advances upon the security of lands and buildings or otherproperties or any interest therein. The assessee had rented out such properties and therental income received therefrom was shown as income from business. The entireincome which accrued and was assessed in the said return was from letting out ofthese properties. It is so recorded and accepted by the assessing officer himself in hisorder but the Assessing Officer took a view that the rental income received byassessee was to be faxed as income from house property. The Commissioner(Appeals) as well as the Tribunal accepted assessee's claim holding that amount inquestion was to be taxed as business income. The High Court, however, restoredorder passed by the Assessing Officer. On appeal to the Supreme Court, it was heldthat in aforesaid circumstances, it is concluded that letting of the properties is in fact\nis the business of the assessee. The assessee therefore, rightly disclosed the incomeunder the head income from business. It cannot be treated as \u2018income from the houseproperty\u2019. Accordingly, instant appeal is allowed and order of the High Court is setaside.

        "content": "6.24_ What are the principles for computing profits & gains from business and\nprofession?\nAns.\nThe principles for computing profits and gains are as under:\n(i)Profits should be understood in a commercial sense: What the Income-tax Actpurports to tax are business profits, and business profits are the true profits of abusiness ascertained according to commercial principles. There may be anexpenditure or there may be a loss which may not be an admissible loss underany of the specific provisions of the statute and yet such an expenditure or losswould have to be allowed in order to determine what are the true profits of abusiness, and it is the duty of every one who has anything to do with taxingbusiness people to understand what are the principles of commercial expediency.Unlessone understands these principlesitisdifficultto makea properassessment, on a business or on a businessman [Aruna Mills Ltd v CIT (1957) 31ITR 153 (Bom)].\n. In order to determine the profits and gains of business, the expenses or theobligations which have been incurred have to be set off against the receipts, asthe profits or gains of a trade or business are the surplus by which the receiptsfrom the trade or business exceed the expenditure necessary for the purpose ofearning such profits or gains [Calcutta Co. Lid v CIT (1959) 37 ITR 1 (SC)].\n(i)Only receipts in the nature of income are profits: Capital receipts are not profits.Thus moneys realised by a company by the issue of shares are merely in thenature of capital receipts. This is true, whether the shares are allotted at par or atpremium, and even though these be issued to the employees of the company inconsiderationof their service. Onthe same principleforfeitureof sharesubscriptions on default of payment of further calls, the shares being reissued toother allottees would not result in any revenue receipts. So also, the surplusresulting from the cancellation of a company\u2019s debentures is not assessable asbusiness income [CIT v Scindia Steam Navigation Co. Ltd (1980) 125 ITR 118(Bom)]. Surpluses realised or paid out on account of currency valuations may becapital or revenue depending upon the circumstances and only those receipts andpayments which are on revenue account can be taken into account in computing\n-the profits of the business. While compensation received in respect of the landsbelonging to an assessee and acquired by the Government would be a capital \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019353\nreceipt, theinterest payable thereon would bea revenue receipt[MotilalChaddami Lal Jain v CIT (1980) 122 ITR 949 (Al))].\nCapital profits are not to be brought into the computation of profits and gainsunless specific provisions are provided in the Act. For example, non-compete feehas been specifically included in section 28 as revenue receipt chargeable to tax.Similarly, section 28(ii) provides that compensation received on termination ormodification of agency is a revenue receipt.\n(iii)Ail trading receipts that are realised must be taken into account: No commercial\nprofit can arise except out of a trading receipt. The profits and gains of businesshave to be arrived at not merely by considering the profits derived by an assesseeon the sale of its stock-in-trade but also the profits earned by it as an integral partof its business activities and embedded in the various kinds of trading recciptswhich are ancillary or incidental to such business. eg where a cement companyearns profits by disposing of the cement bags purchased by it and which havebecame surplus in its hands, such profits will be part of the business profits{[Dalmia Dadri Cement Lid v CIT (1980) 126 ITR 851 (Del)]. So also where acompany collected certain security deposits fromits employees and suchdeposits were forfeited when the employees ceasedto be in the assessee\u2019semployment, such forfeited amount was held to be taxable as income in theassessee\u2019s hands since it was found that the company had claimed and had beenallowed as a deduction of certain expenses which it had incurred in respect of thetraining of those employees [Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd v CIT (1981) 128 ITR 60(P&H)]. It may be noted here that this case does not fall strictly under section41(1) and has to be considered only on the basis of the general principles.\n(iv)Sales tax collections: Sale tax realised by an assessee along with the sale pricewould be part of the trading receipts and assessable as such. If the assessee has topay any sales tax on the sales,it would be allowable as a business liabilityaccording to the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee.\nSales tax collected and kept as a contingency deposit can be considered as atrading receipt: The assessee collected certain amount as deposit towards salestax and showed the amount so collected under the head \u201ccontingency deposit\u201daccount in the balance sheet. He did not deposit the amount to the Government.The Kerala High Court observed that the amount of sales tax collected formedpart of the trading receipts of the assessee. The mere fact that the assesseecreated a head of account \u201cContingency Deposit\u201d would not alter the nature ofreceipt. The court held that the sales tax collected by the assessee and shownunder the head \u201cContingency Deposit\u201d had to be considered as a trading receiptand included in the total income of the assessee. The disallowance under section43B would be attracted for non-payment of sales tax coilected irrespective of thenomenclature used and the accounting head under whichitis categorized[ishwardas Sons v CIT (2007) 295 ITR 473 (Ker)].\n()Charity levies: Indian traders and businessmen sometimes charge a small fee ontheir transactions according to certain customary rates prevalent in a particularMandior Bazar. These collectionsare intendedto be devotedta various \n354A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \ncharitable or educational purposes and are not subject to income-tax where they\nare actually expended for the purpose for which they are collected.\nAccording to CBDT instruction, the Assessing Officers are now required tosatisfy themselves about the bona fides of the accounts of such collections withdue regard to the market usage and the ultimate disposal of the collections and toassess or reassess the amounts which have been directly or indirectly diverted tobusiness or private purposes of the trader instead of spending them on charitable\nactivities,\n(vi)Receipts on currency fluctuations: Where the sale price due by or to an Indiantrader is outstanding and, on account of the devaluation of the Indian currency,\nhe has to pay or he receives an increased sale price, it has been held that theamount he pays or receives is one claimed, paid and accepted as enhanced valueof the sale price and would constitute a loss or, as the case may be, businessincome [Sutlej Cotton Mills Ltd v CIT (1979) 116 ITR 1 (SC)].\nCurrency fluctuation due to revenue account (e.g. purchase of raw material) shallbe taxed as income or deductile as expense on accrual basis if the assessee isfollowing mercantile system of accounting [CIT v Woodward Governor IndiaPyt, Ltd. (2009) 179 Taxman 326 (SC)].\nW.e.f. A.Y. 2019-20, besides existing section 43A relating to \"special provisionsconsequential to changes in rate of exchange of currency\", section 43AA relating\nio \u201ctaxation of foreign exchange fluctuation\u201d has been inserted by the FinanceAct, 2018.\n(vii)Profit or loss in Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Madras High Court in IndianOverseas Bank Lid v CIT (1991) 183 ITR 200 (Mad) has held that a loss or profiton foreign exchange transactions can be ascertained only after the settlement ofthe forward contracts and not before and so long as that stage has not beenreached, the loss can only be notional and not actual or real and a notional losscannot be claimed as a deduction. It was held that the same principle would holdgood even in case of a profit. Following this principle the Madras High Court intheir decision in Indian Overseas Bank Ltd v CIT (2002) 121 Taxman 16 (Mad)held that the notional profit arrived at on the basis of the rate of exchange whichprevailed on the last day of the accounting year, without an actual settlement of\nthe forward contract in foreign exchange, did not present the income of theassessee and the notional profit could not be subjected to tax.\n(viii)Receipt for stoppage of business: Where a trade is not carmed on, a receipt,thoughit may involve a revenue aspect, would not be a business profit, as itcannot be described as a trading receipt. In Senairam Doongarmall v CIT (1961)42 ITR 392 (SC), the assessee\u2019s business in tea got completely stopped as aresult of the requisitioning of its factory and other buildings for defence purposesby the Military authorities. The assessee received a compensation calculated onthe basis of the out-turn of tea that would have been manufactured by theassessee during the years of requisition.It was held that the compensation\n' received could not be a revenue receipt, because the payment was not by way of\nadjustment towards business receipts but was payment for stoppage of business. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019355\nIt was pointed out that where an assessee does not carry on business at all, thesection cannot be made applicable, and the compensation that he receives cannotbear the character of profits of a business.\n(&)Trading receipts are profits only when these are realised: Even if a transactionbe on trading account, it is only such moneys as are due or have been earned thatform the profits, Actual payment of cash by the payer to the payee is, however,not necessary to constitute a receipt or realisation. Generally speaking, it may besaid that wherever the payer deals with a sum of money due to the payee in anymanner according to the directions or instructions of the payee, so as to obain avalid discharge for himself and the payee obtains the benefit thereof, there wouldbe a case of realisation by the payee [CIT v Arunachalam Chettiar (1924) 1 ITC\n75 (Mad)]. Where no money is realised or is immediately due, thereis no\n. income.\nDeposit from customers \u2014 Whether income?: What is described as deposit isprima facie not income because deposit is normally expected to be refunded oradjusted. However, there are cases where it has been held that it may have thecharacter of income if the deposit is either described as non-refundable or fromthe terms of agreement such refund is not contemplated.\nWhere deposit has been held to be income: Where in the context of the buy backscheme, which had been framed by the Government, it was mandatory for thedistillers to buy back the bottles in which the intoxicating liquor had been sold, itwas held that the very nomenclature indicates the scheme involved initial saleand subsequent buy back. The deposit was therefore held to be taxable, thoughnot the entire deposit but the amount left after the refund made out of the same[Punjab Distilling Industries Lid v CIT (1959) 35 ITR 59 (SO)j.\nCases where deposit held not to be income: Where the intention of the assessee\nin receiving the deposit was not to treat the delivery of the bottles as part of thetransaction of sale, and the deposit was not intended to be regarded as theproceeds of the sale, the tribunal held that deposit was meant to be a deposit onlyand not consideration for the sale, and that deposit was one which was required\nto be returned as and when the bottles were returned. It was not the intention ofthe assessee to use the amount of the deposit to buy back the bottles which hadnot been sold in the first place. This judgment of the tribunal was upheld by theSupreme Court [United Breweries Ltd y State of A.P. (1997) 10 STC 177 (SC);CIT v Madurai Soft Drinks (P) Ltd (2000) 241 ITR 229 (Mad)].\nThe amount which the society deducts from the cane prices as per its bye lawstowards refundable and non refundable deposits cannot be treated as the incomeof the society as the bye laws contain the provisions of transferability of depositand refund of deposit to members at the time of cessation of membership or tolegal heirs at the time of death [Siddheshwar Sahakari Sakhar Kaarkhana Lid vCIT (2004) 270 ITR 1 (SC)].\n(xi)Profits chargeable are real, not fictional profits: The profits that are chargedunder the Act are real profits and those which are regarded as profits in thecommercial world. No tax may be levied on fictional or notional profits. Thus, a \n356A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nbottling company which collects a security deposit in respect of the bottles andcrates supplied to customers cannot claim a loss merely on the ground that theamount of security was less than the price of the bottles and crates [Tripty Drinks\nP. Ltd v CIT (1978) 112 ITR 721 (Ori)]. It should be borne in mind that noperson can be compelled to make a profit out of any transaction which he entersinto, nor can any person be said to earn a profit by his dealing with himself. Forinstance, a dealer in shares, by transferring the shares from his trading account to\nan investment account at the prevalent market rate cannot claim a trading losswhere such rate is less than the rate obtaining on the first day of the accountingyear at which it was reflected in the assessees books [C/T v Dhanuka & Sons(1980) 124 ITR 24 (Cal)]. Similarly no profit could be assumed in this case if themarket value was more than the opening value of stock.\nWhere assessee entered into a joint venture agreement with a builder and he gavehis land to construct a housing project in licu of having a right to sell certainconstructed area in said project, since assessee had not yet exercised his right to\nsell any constructed area in said project, no anticipated business gain could betaxed. [Dheeraj Amin v ACIT (2016) 71 taxmann.com 288 (Bangalore) (Trib):(2015) 172 TTJ 228 (Bangalore) (Trib)]\nAgain no profit would arise by a mere revaluation of assets.\n(xii)Exchange of stock may be treated as realisation: Where an assessee dealing inshares, exchanged the shares of Company A held by it as stock in trade forshares of Company B,it was held that the difference between the cost of theshares of first company and market value of the shares of the second company onthe date of such exchange had to be treated as a profit of the assessee [OrientTrading Co. Lid v CIT (1997) 224 ITR 371 (SC)].\n(xiti)Profits have to be ascertained on an annual basis: A business is in general acontinuous activity extending over several years and for the purposes of anassessee\u2019s accounting as well as for income-tax purposes, profits have to beascertained on an annual basis. It cannot be said that no profits arise merelybecause certain activities done during the previous year are not concluded. Thus\nin a contract business, profits have to be computed for each accounting year eventhough some of the contracts may extend for more than one year.\n(xiv)Interest received by a contractor on compensation awarded by an arbitrator isbusiness income: Where an arbitrator awarded a certain amount by way ofcompensation for work done and also awarded interest,it was held that theinterest awarded by the arbitrator was income and it had to be assessed as a-business receipt of the assessee [CIT v B.N. Agarwala and Coa. (2003) 259 ITR754 (SC)].\n(xv)Prize on unsold and unclaimed ticket is a business income of the lottery agent:Income accruing to an agent/trader in respect of prizes on unsold/unclaimedlottery tickets in possession of the agent/trader is income from business and doesnot constitute winning of lotteries [Director of State Lotteries v CIT (1999) 238ITR 1 (Gau)j. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019357 \n(xvi)Subsidy to assist carrying on business is trading receipt. Where the payment ismade by the Government which is in the nature of subsidy given to the assesseefor carrying on his trade or business, is a trading receipt specially whenit isrelated to the sale of its product and payable after the production has commenced[Sahney Steel & Press Works Ltd v CIT (1997) 228 ITR 253 (SC)].\nHowever, where the assessee received subsidy for the purpose of setting up anew business/unit of a business or expanding existing business/existing unit ofbusiness, it was held that such receipt of subsidy should be treated as capital innature.[CITv DhampurSugarMillsLtd.(2013)40taxmann.com94(Ali):(2014) 360 ITR 82 (AlDj\nWhere assessee was granted Government subsidy for purpose of setting up newindustry, and not merely for acquisition of plant or machinery, said subsidyamount would not be deducted from actual cost of plant and machinery. [PCT vWelspun Steel Ltd. (2019) 264 Taxman 252 (Bom)]\n(xvii)Refund of excise duty and grant of interest subsidy under the incentive schemeformulated by Central Government for public interest, namely, to accelerateindustrial development, generate employment and create opportunities for selfemployment in state of Jammu and Kashmir are to be treated as a capital receipt[Shree Balaji Alloys v CIT (2011) 333 ITR 335 (J&K)}.\nAssessee was running a manufacturing unit in a specified backward area. By wayof exemption of sales tax payments under UP State subsidy scheme, assessee\n\u2018was allowed to retain sales tax amounts collected from customers/service users,\nsubject to quantitative limit of 100% of capital expenditure. Assessee hadflexibility of using amounts retained for any purpose, not necessarily capital.Thus, it was held that such subsidy was revenue in nature and was taxable asprofits [C27 v Bhushan Steels & Strips Lid. (2017) 83 taxmann.com 204 (Del)]\n(xviit)Receipts whether revenue or capital in nature: The character of the receipt in thehands of the assessee has to be determined with respect to the purpose for which\nit is received. If the object of the subsidy scheme was to enable the assessee torun the business more profitably, then the receipt is on revenue account. On theother hand, if the object of the assistance under the subsidy scheme was to enable\nto set up a new unit or to expand the existing unit, then the receipt of subsidy ison capital account (CIT v Ponni Sugars & Chemicals Ltd (2008) 306 ITR 392(SC). See also C/T v Siya Ram Garg (HUF) (2011) 49 DTR 126 (P&H).\nLaw laid down in Sahney Steel 228 ITR 253 (SC) and Ponni Sugars 306 ITR 392(SC) regarding the taxability of subsidies as a revenue receipt does not apply tovoluntary subsidies (subvention) paid by a holding company to its loss makingsubsidiary. The said subsidy is to protect the capital investment of the holdingcompany and is a capital receipt in the hands of the recipient. [Siemens PublicCommunications Network Ltd v CIT (2017) 390 ITR 1 (SC)}.\n(xix)Tender deposit forfeited shall be business income: Where a tender amount givenby the buyer was forfeited by the assessee when the tenderers modified the termsof contract,it was held that the amount obtained by the assessee is only incompensation for the breach of contract by the buyer and thus revenue in nature \n358A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nand chargeable to tax [CIT v State Trading Corporation of India Ltd (2001) 247ITR 115 (Del)].\n(xx)Forfeiture of margin money is business income: Where a bank was purchasingshares and securities on behalf of the constituents and obtains commission andservice charges and purchase was made during the course of business, the marginmoney forfeited by the bank consequent to non-taking of the scripts by thebuyers, it was held such forfeited amount shall not be reduced from the purchaseprice of shares but shali be treated at its regular business income [CIT v LakshmiVilas Bank Ltd (1996) 220 ITR 305 (SC)].\n1\n(xxi)Deferred income: The concept of deferred income is alien to the Act as there isabsolutely nothing in the Act to treat part of the income as deferred income and\nto offer it for taxation at the own will of the assessee, ie income attracts tax when\nit comes into existence [Sterling Holiday Resorts Undia) Ltd v ACIT (2007) 295ITR (AT) 162 (Chen)].\n(xxii)Insurance compensation for loss of raw materials is a trading recipt: Where theassessee incurred loss of raw materials, stores and spare parts and loose tools, in\na fire accident and received compensation from the insurance company in excessof its value, the excess amount received is a trading receipt [C7T v NeedleIndustries (India) Ltd (2000) 245 TFR 556 (Mad)j.\n(xxiti)Reimbursement of loss in respect of pledged stock-in-trade by a bank is a trading\nrecipt. Where the assessee pledged stock-in-trade witha bank to obtain anoverdraft and the stock was damaged, the amount so received representedcompensation for loss or damage to .stock-in-trade. Thus, the same wouldconstitute a trading receipt [Ramesh Narain Saxena v CIT (1996) 220 ITR 19(SC)}.\n(xxiv)Compensation received by the developer from the land owner on termination ofdevelopment: Compensation received from the land owner on termination ofdevelopment agreement was the deprivation of potential income and loss offuture profits as mentioned in the settlement agreement and not for divesting theassessee of its earning apparatus, as restrictive covenant in the said agreementonly prohibited the assessee from undertaking a similar project in the vicinity of\nthe existing project without consent of the land owner for the limited duration ofthree years, and therefore,the compensation wasa revenue receipt [AnsalProperties & Industries Ltd v CIT (2011) 238 CTR (Del) 126].\n(xxv)Year in which service charges received in advance are taxable\nWhere the Assessee-company, engaged in business of manufacture and sale oftelevision sets, received advance service charges from buyers for services to berendered in second year from sale and for this amount, the assessee maintainedseparate account and job cards, it was held that said amount could not be treated\nas income of assessee of the year of receipt.

Profits from an illegal business are subject to taxjust as from a legal business. In fact, the Supreme Court had held that where incomefrom an illegal business is assessed to tax, the loss arising directly in the course ofthe business is deductible as business expenditure in computing the assessee\u2019s profitsfrom the business.\n\u2018In case the smuggling activity be regarded as a business activity, persons who are\nengaged in such activity are deemed to be aware of consequences of being detectedby customs authorities and confiscation of currency notes. The confiscation ofcurrency notes is a loss occasioned in pursuing the business and is a loss in the sameway as if the currency notes had been stolen or dropped on the way when carrying onthe business. Such loss which springs directly from the carrying on of the saidbusiness is an incidental one [C/T v Piara Singh (1980) 124 ITR 40 (SC)].\nThe Explanation to section 37(1) inserted retrospectively w.e.f. 1-4-1962 by theFinance Act, 1998 is confined only to disallowance of an expenditure for prohibitedpurposes but a loss is different from an expenditure tainted with illegality.\nWhere the loss arose as a result of seizure and confiscation of illegal stock in trade:The Supreme Court in the case of Dr T.A. Quereshi v CIT (2006) 287 ITR 547 (SC)held that Explanation to section 37 restricting the allowability of expenditure forinfringement of law applies to business expenditure and not to business loss. Since in\nthe instant case, there is no claim of business expenditure and it is a case of businessloss, such loss shall be allowable.",

        "content": "6.61What are general principles followed for allowability of deductions under thehead profits and gains of business or profession?\nAns.The following principles! should be followed for allowability of deductions:\n(1) Expenditure should have been incurred during the previous year: Any loss orexpenditure can be claimed as a deduction, only if it has been incurred during therelevant previous year. For this purpose, we haveto keepin mind method ofaccounting followed by the assessee. If the assessee follows the cash system ofaccounting, only those expenses which have been actually paid during the previousyear shall be allowable. On the other hand, if the assessee follows the mercantilesystem of accounting then the expenses incurred during the previous year can beallowed irrespective of the fact whether they have been actually paid or not.\nBenefit of expenditure may extend beyond the year of expenditure: It is not necessarythat the benefit of the expenditure should be confined to the year of expenditure. Forinstance, the benefit of repairs executed in any year would naturally enure for severalfuture years, but the expenditure cannot be disailowed for the reason.\n(2) Expenditure should be incurred for the purpose of the business: An expenditurecan be allowed as deduction only if it has been incurred for the purpose of thebusiness of the assessee. Any expenditure not incurred for the assessee\u2019s ownbusiness shall not be allowed as a deduction. It is not necessary that the expenditureshould result in any profit to the assessee. What is essential is that the expenditure isincurred for the purpose of the business. It is also not essential that it should beincurred to earn a profit. Expenditure incurred for preservation of the business,rationalisation of the administrationand modernisationof the equipmentareallowable expenses.\nIncidental benefit enuring to a third party is no bar to deduction: If the payment orexpenditure is incurred for the purpose of the trade of the assessee, it does not matterthat the payment may enure incidentally for the benefit of a third party.\n(3) No deduction is allowable in respect of a discontinued business: It is necessarythat the business, in respect of which the expenses are incurred should have beencarried on by the assessee during the previous year. In respect of the business which\n \n1In this connection, also refer Question Numbers 6.62, 6.63 and 6.64 relating to ICDS. \n386A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nhas been discontinued before the commencement of the previous year, the assesseecannot claim any expenditure/loss during the previous year.\nAllowances, eg interest on money borrowed, write off of allowances and bad debts,which relate to business, closed before the commencement of the previous yearcannot be deducted from or set off against the profit of a separate existing business.\n \nIf, however, a business is carried on for some time in the accounting year, section 28\nis attracted.\nWhere one business activity has been discontinued and another continues to exist it\nis a mixed question of fact and law whether the discontinued activity was separateand distinct from the existing business or whether it was merely the branch of theexisting business and the two constituted one and the same business. In the lattercase,theallowancespertainingto discontinuedactivitycanbedeductedincomputing the profit of existing business but not in the former case.\nThe assessee company had started manufacturing of powdered soft drink. During theaccounting year relevant to the assessment year 2003-04,it decided to stop itsmanufacturing activity as it was found to be non-profitable. Many of employees whowere directly in the manufacturing activity were laid off and the severance costs tothose employees were paid. Assessee continued to do the trading activity. The Courtheld that suspension of one of the activities did not amount to closer of business,hence the expenditure was allowable [C77 v Kjs India P. Ltd, (2012) 340 ITR 380(Del)].\nSection 176(3A) and 176(4) provide the exception where the income of a business orprofession received in an previous year subsequent to the year of discontinuance of\nthe business or profession is brought to charge. In such cases, expenses incurred after\nthe year of discontinuance to earn such income should be allowed as deduction.\n(4) Expenses incurred before the setting up of a business are not allowed: As ageneral rule, any expenditure incurred prior to the setting up of business is notallowable as a deduction as the previous year of a new business commences on thedate when the business is set up. A business is set up when it is established or set onfoot. There may be an interregnum between the setting up of a business and its actualcommencement. Expenses incurred after setting up of the business but before theactual commencement of business can be allowed as a deduction under sections 30 to\n37.\nA unit cannot be said to have been set up unless it is ready to discharge the function\nfor which it is being set up. Setting up of business is distinct from commencement ofbusiness. It is only when the unit has been put into such a shape that it can startfunctioning as a business or a manufacturing organisation that it can be said that theunit has been set up. Expenses incurred after the setting up of the business aredeductible as revenue expenditure [DHL Express (1) Pvt. Ltd v ACIT (2009) 124 TTJ108 (Mum)].\n(5) No deduction is allowed on account of loss of wasting assets: The Act providesfor no allowance in respect of wasting assets, except as regards tangible assets bybuildings, machinery, land or furniture, intangible assets being know-how patents,copyrightslicence, farmableor any other businessor commenceright under \nincome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019387 \nsection 32, and as regards animals under section 36(1)(vi). The general principle is\nthat, everything of the nature of income shall be assessed from whatsoever source itmay be derived, whether temporary or permanent steady or fluctuating, precarious orsecure.In arrivingat profits,itis immaterialto consider whether the capital-investment by which the profits are earned remains unconsumed or undiminished, orgets consumed in the process of yielding income. Thus if a coal mine is beingworked and is getting exhausted by the constant removal of coal, no deduction ispermissible on account of the exhaustion of coal.\n(6) Reserves/provisions for contingencies or anticipated losses cannot be claimed as\na deduction: In cases where the assessee provides for any contingent liability likebad debts, sales tax, ete which have not arisen during the previous year but are onlyanticipated to arise in the future, no deduction is allowable. Deduction can beclaimed only when the expenditure or the loss has been actually incurred during theprevious year.",

It is only when the unit has beenput into such a shape that it can start functioning as a business or a manufacturing \n388A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\norganisation that it can be said that the unit has been set up. The commercial sale ofthe product is not the criterion for deciding as to when a business is set up. Thesetting up of plant and machinery and commencement of production are the materialfactors for deciding as to whether a business has commenced or not [C/T v ElectronIndia (2000) 241 ITR 166 (Mad)].\nThus,if the production has commencedin any previous year but the productmanufactured could not be sold in the said previous year, the deduction of allexpenses including administrative expenses and depreciation shall be allowed.\n \nExpenses incurred after the date of setting upof the businessis allowedasexpenditure.

However, Para 1 of ICDS Istates that it deals with significant accounting policies. Accounting policies\nare applied for maintenance of books of accounts and preparing financialstatements. What is the interplaybetween ICDS I and mainienance of books\nof accounts?\nAnswer: As stated'in the Preamble, ICDS is not meant for maintenance ofbooks of accounts or preparing financial statements. Persons are required tomaintainbooksof accountsandpreparefinancialstatementsasperaccounting policies applicable to them. For example, companies are required\nto maintain booksof account and prepare financial statementsas perrequirements of Companies Act, 2013. The accounting policies mentioned inICDS-I being fundamentalin nature shall be applicable for computingincome under the heads \"Profits and gains of business or profession\" or\"Income from other sources\".\nInconsistency between judicial precedents and ICDS\nQuestion: Certain ICDS provisions are inconsistent with judicial precedents.Whether these judicial precedents would prevail over ICDS?\nAuswer: The ICDS have been notified after due deliberation and afterexamining judicial views for bringing certainty on the issues covered by it.Certain judicial pronouncementswere pronouncedintheabsenceofauthoritative guidance on these issues under the Act for computing Incomeunder the head \"Profits and gains of business or profession\" or Income fromother sources. Since certainty is now provided by notifying ICDS undersection145(2),theprovisionsof ICDSshallbeapplicabletothetransactional issues dealt therein \u2018in relation to assessment year 2017-18 andsubsequent assessment years.\nApplicability of ICDS in case of assesses covered\u2019 under presumptivescheme of. taxation\nQuestion: Does ICDS apply to non-corporate taxpayers who are not required\nto maintain books of account and/or those who are covered by presumptivescheme of taxation like sections 44AD, 44AE, 44ADA, 44B, 44BB, 44BBA,\netc. of the Act? \nIncome under the Head\u2018Prafits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019.393 \nAnswer: ICDS is applicable to specified persons having income chargeableunder the head \u2018Profits and gains of business or profession\u2019 or Income fromother sources'. Therefore, the relevant provisions of ICDS shall also apply tothe persons computing income under the relevant presumptive taxationscheme.

However, MCA has notified in February 2015 a new set of standardscalled \"Indian Accounting Standards' (Ind-AS). How will ICDS apply tocompanies which adopted Ind-AS?\nAnswer: ICDS shall apply for computation of taxable income under the head\"Profit and gains of business or profession\" or \u201cIncome from other sources\"under the Income Tax Act.

E.g. provision forwarranty expenses on sales made.\nExample\nFinance year 2020-21\nExpected loss = $25,000\nAnticipated income = 25,000\nFinancial year 2021-22\nActual loss = 225,000\nActual income %5,000\nIn the financial year 2020-21 income tax shall be payable on the anticipatedincome of 75,000 but foresseeable loss of %25,000 shall not be allowed asdeduction in financial year 2020-21 as per ICDS. However, in the financialaccounts loss will be recorded to the extent of 725,000 but anticipated incomeshall not be recorded.\nIn the financial year 2021-22,.the actual loss of 25,000 shall be allowed underincome tax as per ICDS but actual income of %5,000 shall not be taxable as it isalready taxed in the financial year 2020-21.

To repair is to restore(building, machine, garments, tissues strength, etc) to good condition, renovate, andmend by replacing or refixing parts or an asset compensating loss or exhaustion. The \nA Compendium of Issues on Income Tax 424\nconcept of repairs however, presupposes an asset already in use in the business. If\ninitial repairs are carried out to a newly acquired asset to install it in the business,such expenditure is capital in nature [Liberty Cinema v CIT (1964) 52 ITR 153\n(Cal)].\nRepairs v Renewal\n \nOften, repairs may involve renewal of parts. Such parts may be a part subordinate tothe main asset or a part thereof. \u201cRepair\u201d is a comprehensive word which means\u201cmake good defects\u201d and which therefore must include renewal wherever necessary.Such type of repair is known as restoration by renewal. Expenditure incurred onrenewal of small or subsidiary parts is generally treated as revenue expenditure.However, it is necessaryto consider the size and importance of the work involved todetermine if it could be regarded as reconstruction of an asset, in which case,itwould amount to a capital expenditure.\nRepairs should be distinguished from renewalinas muchas renewal meansreconstruction of the premises entirely or substantially [C/T v Sri Rama Sugar MillsLtd (1952) 21 ITR 191 (Mad}].\nA repair may require renewal or replacement but all replacements or renewals are notnecessarily repairs. While the restoration of the stability or safety of a subordinate orsubsidiary part of a building or any portion of it, can, in law be considered as arepair, the reconstruction of the entirety of the subject-matter cannot be so regarded.\nIn repairs,it would be seen that the identity of the article remains and what isreplaced or renewed is only a part of the whole. If the entire article is replaced, theidentity is gone and there is no question of repairs, the old article has disappearedand a new one has come into its place. So, the essential thing is that in order that an\nact might be said to amount to a repair, the renovation or the substitutions shouldextend only to a part or parts [OGrady v Bullcraft Main Collieries Ltd (1932) 17 TC93}.\nCurrent repairs\nThe expression \u2018current repairs\u2019 means expenditure on buildings, machinery, plant orfurniture which is not for the purpose of renewal or restoration but which is only for\nthe purpose of preserving or maintaining an already existing asset and which doesnot bring a new asset into existence or does not give to the assessee a new ordifferent advantage [Ballimal Naval Kishore v CIT (1997) 224 ITR 414 (SC)].\nCurrent repairs indicates repairs which are attended to when the need for them arisesfrom a businessman\u2019s point of view and which are not allowed to fall into arrears or\nto be accumulated [Himnayun Properties Ltd v CIT (1962) 44 ITR 73 (Cal)).\n \nCurrent repairs is not the same as petty repairs [Mahalakshmi Textiles Mills (1967)66 ITR 710 (SC)].\nLuxury repairs are not current repairs; current repairs means those that are neededperiodically to maintain the building [Humayun Properties Ltd v CIT (1962) 44 ITR\n73 (Cal)]. \nIncome under the Head'Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019425 \nThe wooden flooring of a textile mill is damaged; it is renovated. It has been held\nthat the term repairs has to be understood in contradistinction to reconstruction and\nthat the question of amount of expenditure does not count in such cases, for that doesnot change the nature of expenditure [Bansilal Abirchand Spg & Wvg Mills (RB) vCIT (1957) 31 ITR 427 (Nag)).\nThe expression \u201ccurrent repairs\u201d connotes repairs which are attended to when theneed for them arises from the assessee\u2019s point of view and which are not allowed tobe accumulated. The simple test that must be constantly borne in mind is whether as\na result of expenditure which is claimed as expenditure for current repairs, what isreally being done is to preserve and maintain an already existing asset. The object ofexpenditure is not to bring a new asset into existence, nor is its object the obtaining\nof new or fresh advantage. The basic test to find out as to what would constitutecurrent repairs is that the expenditure must have been incurred to preserve andmaintain an already existing asset and the object of the expenditure must \u2018not be tobring a new asset into existence or to obtain a new advantage [C77 v SaravanaSpinning Mills (P) Lid (2007) 163 Taxman 196 (SC)].\nExpenditure incurred by assessee did not enhance value of its capital assets and itwas necessary to repair damage caused by fire/flood, same was to be treated asrevenue expenditure. Hence thesaid expenditure was to be allowable under section30. [CIT'v Norince (P.) Lid. (2015) 56 taxmann.com 42 (Cal):(2015) 231 Taxman 84\n(Cal)}.",

Are there any important judicial decisions?\nAns,In respect of machinery, plant or furniture used for the purpose of business, thefollowing deductions are allowable:\n(a)amount paid on account of current repairs,\n(5)any insurance premium paid in respect of insurance against risk of damage ordestruction of the plant and machinery or furniture.\nThe amount paid on account of current repairs shall not include any expenditure inthe nature of capital expenditure.\nJudicial decisions\n(1) When machinery, etc is kept ready for use at any moment in a particular factoryunder an express agreement from which taxable profits are earned, the machinerycan be said to have been used for the purpose of the business which earned theprofits although it was not actually worked [Whittle Anderson Ltd v CIT (1971) 79ITR 613 (Bom)). Similar is the case where the machinery was kept ready for use butcould not be used due to labour trouble or lack of demand [Capital Bus Service Pvt.Lid v CIT (1980) 123 ITR 404 (Del)]. However a contrary view has been taken in thecase of Dinesh Kumar Gulabchand Agrawal v CIT (2004) 267 ITR 769 (Bom) where\nit was held that the expression used means actually used for the purpose of thebusiness and not merely ready for use.\n(2) Repairs and renovation to furnaces which are annually required can be treated ascurrent repairs [CIT v Seraikella Glass Works (P) Ltd (1986) 157 ITR 584 (Pat)].\n(3) In CIT v Goyal Oil Mills (1970) 78 ITR 414 (Pun) it was held that expenditure onrepairs of machinery, which ultimately, belongsto the owners and not to theassessee, cannot be said to be in the nature of capital expenditure.\n(4) \u2018Current repairs\u2019 means only such repairs as are necessitated by the day to daywear duringthe relevant previousyear only;whilerepairsonly meanevenaccumulated repairs of several years [Girdhari Dass & Sons v CIT (1976) 105 ITR339 (All]. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019427\n(5) Where the assessee has incurred the expenditure on repair and renovation just toimprove the ordinary activity of the business by attracting more customers into thetheatre but not by adding any fixed asset in the premises, it was held that expenditureincurred is deductible [C7T v Laxmi Tatkies (2005) 275 ITR 125 (Guj)].\nAmount paid by the assessee for customising ihe software \u201caccordingto newrequirement which involved only a modification of the existing software and notacquisition of any new software is revenue expenditure [CIT v Voith Paper FabricsIndia Lid. (2011) 64 DTR 58: 245 CTR 516 (P&H).\nIncrease in life of existing assets beyond their original estimated economic life byrepairs and maintenance could not be taken as ground for treating such expense ascapital in nature. [CIT v Vishal Paper Industries (2013) 351 ITR 478 (P&H)).\nTo allow an expenditure as revenue expenditure under section 31, the basic testwould be to find out whether expenditure incurred was to 'preserve and maintain\u2019 analready existing asset without bringing new asset into existence. [CJT v PrabhuSpinning Mills (P.) Ltd. (2014) 52 taxmann.com 358 (Mad)].\nEditorial: Order of Tribunal in Vishal Paper Industries v JCIT (2013) 21 ITR 220(Chandigarh)(Trib) has been affirmed.\nAssessee-company was engaged in business of manufacturing cotton yarns andtextile. During relevant year, assessee claimed deduction in respect of as repairs andreplacement of machinery. Assessing Authority disallowed assessee's claim onground that it related to installation of machinery and was in nature of capitalexpenditure. Tribunal, however, allowed assessee\u2019s claim. High Court upheld orderof Tribunal. It was noted that Court in C?T v Saravana Spg. Mills (P.) Ltd. (2007)293 ITR 201: 163 Taxman 201 (SC) took a view that in case of textile mill therewere several departments and in each department there were several machinesperforming different functions and, thus, in such a situation, repair/substitution of anold machine wouldnot come within definitionof word \u2018current repairs' anddeduction could not be claimed thereunder. In view of aforesaid decision of Court,impugned order allowing assessee's claim for deduction under head 'current repairs\u2019,was to be set aside. [C?7T v Sarangpur Cotton Mfg. Co. Lid.

However, if thereplacement is total or the impact of replacement is so significant that it brings a new \n428A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nasset into existence or results in an advantage of enduring nature to the assessee, then\nit would constitute a capital expenditure. Some important judicial pronouncements\nare explained below:\n@)In CiT v Sri Mangayarkarasi Mills P. Ltd (2009) 315 ITR 114 (SC), the\u2018Supreme Court held that each machine in a textile mill is an independent andseparate machine forming part of an integrated manufacturing process and theentire textile mill machinery cannot be considered as a single asset. Therefore,upholding the test of enduring benefit it was held that replacement expenses ofmachines are towards acquisition of capital asset and does not amount to currentrepairs deductible under section 31of the Act or as revenue expendituredeductible under section 37 of the Act.\n(ii)\nIn ClT.v Saravana Spinning Mills (P.) Ltd (2007) 293 ITR. 201 (SC), the\n \n_Supreme Court held that the expression \u2018current repairs\u2019 denotes repairs whichare attendedto whenthe needfor them arises from the viewpoint of abusinessman. It further observed that the basic test to find out as to what wouldconstitute current repairsis that the expenditure must have been incurred to\u201cpreserve and maintain\u2019 an already existing asset. The Court held that the word\u2018repair\u2019 implies the existence of a part of the machine which has malfunctioned.\nIt was held that the expenditure incurred towards replacement of a ring framewould not come within the meaning of the words \u2018current repairs\u2019 as each ringframeisan independent and separate machine capableof performing anindependent and specific function.\n(iii)In Hanuman Motor Service v CIT (1967) 66 ITR 88 (Mysore), the Mysore HighCourt held that expenses for replacing old unworkable petrol engines with new\ndiesel] engines in buses of an assessee engaged in the business of plying buses onhire are allowable as current repairs as in that case the machinery concerned isthe bus and engine is only a part of the bus.\nGv)In DCITv S.T.N. Textiles Ltd (2002) 257 ITR 161 (Ker), the Kerala High Courtheld that where the assessee replaced the electric control panel which wasdamaged beyond repair with a new control panel, the expenditure on suchreplacement cannot be treated as \u2018repair\u2019 under section 31. It would be a case ofcapital investment and would not be a case of repair.\n|(v)Replacement of moulds did not result in creation of new capital asset or benefit\nof enduring nature. Mere fact that moulds were used in production process couldnot be conclusiveastothe natureof expenditure,hence,expenditureonreplacement of moulds was revenue expenditure [CIT v Malerkotla Steels &Alloys (P.) Lid (2011) 237 CTR 201: 49 DTR 1 (P&H)].\n(vi)Where machinery which wasrepairedhadoutliveditsutilityand hugeexpenditure was incurred by replacing many vital parts in order to make thesame functional and the expenditure was of such nature thatit brought intoexistence a. new machinery altogether and consequently, there was a benefit ofenduring nature to the assessee even \u2018though technically no new asset came intoexistence.It was held that it is in the nature of capital expenditure on which \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019429 \ndepreciation can be claimed [Bharat Gears Ltd.v CIT (2011) 337 ITR 370\n(Del)).\n(vii)To test an expenditure to be covered within the ambit of s 31, it is to be decidedwhether an expenditure is incurred in relation to preserve/maintain an existing\nasset or to bring into existence a new asset. \u2018Replacing\u2019 an asset cannot betermed in equal to \u2018current repairs\u2019 carried on the asset.

The Websters New International Dictionary defines theword building as that which is built specifically: (a) as now generally used a fabric oredifice, framed or constructed, designed to stand more or less permanently andcovering a space of land for use as a dwelling, store house, factory, shelter for beasts\nor some other useful purpose. Building in this sense does not include a mere wall,fence, monument, hoarding or similar structure though designed for permanent usewhereit stands, nor a steamboat, ship or other vessel of navigation. From thisdefinition it does not appear that the existence of a roof is always necessary for astructure to be regarded as a building. Residential buildings ordinarily have roofs butthere can be a non-residential building of which a roof is not necessary.

It includes any article or object, fixed or movable, live ordead, used by a businessman for carrying on his business.Itis not necessarilyconfined to an apparatus which is used for mechanical operations or processes or isemployed in mechanical or industrial business.[t would not, however, cover thestock-in-trade, that is goods bought or made for sale by a businessman. It would alsonot include an article which is merely a part of the premises in which the business iscarried on. An article to qualify as plant must furthermore have some degree of \n434A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \ndurability and that which is quickly consumed or worn out in the course of a fewoperations or within a short time cannot properly be called plant. But an articlewould not be any the less plant because it is small in size or cheap in value or a largequantity thereof is consumed while being employed in carrying on business. In theultimate analysis, the inquiry which must be madeis as to what operation theapparatus performs in the assessee\u2019s business. The relevant test to be applied is; does\n \nit fulfil the function of plant in the assessee\u2019s trading activity? Is it the tool of thetaxpayer\u2019s trade? If it is, then it is plant, no matter that it is not very long-lasting ordoes not contain working parts such as a machine does and plays a merely passiverole in the accomplishment of the trading purpose.\nWhat is the different between plant and machinery?",

Thus, goodwill is also a\u2018business or commercial right of similar nature\u2019, and hence, eligible for depreciationunder s 32 of the Act. However, in another judgment in the case of R. G. Keswani vACIT (2009) 308 ITR 271 (Mum), it was held that goodwill is not an intangible assetand is not eligible for depreciation under section 32.\nGoodwill is also an intangible asset of similar nature referred to in clause (i) ofsection 32(1), and therefore, depreciation is allowable on the same [Kotak ForexBrokerage Ltd v ACIT (2010) 41 DTR 387 (Mum) (Trib)].\nPayment made towards goodwill for ensuring retention and continued business in thehospital acquired by assessee on going concer basis in comparable with trade mark,franchise,copyright,etc,referredinsubclause(i)of section32(1) hence,depreciation is allowable [B. Ravendran Pillai v CIT (2010) 47 DTR 81 (Ker)].\nGoodwill is an asset under Explanation 3(b) to section 32(1) of the Act. A reading of\nthe words \u201cany other business or commercial rights of similar nature\u201d in clause (6) ofExplanation3to section32({1)indicatesthat goodwill wouldfall under the\nexpression. The principle of ejusdem generis would strictly apply while interpretingthe expression [C/T v Smifs Securities Lid (2012) 348 ITR 302 (SC)].\nDepreciation is not allowable on goodwill in AY 1987-88 as amendment of s. 32\nw.e.f. 1-4-1997 is not retrospective. [C/T v Wipro Ltd. (No.2) (2014) 360 ITR 658(Kam.)(HC)}.Payment .of compensation made by assessee-firm to its retiring partners was to betreated as goodwill and, since, goodwill is an asset under Explanation 3(b) to section32(1),assessee\u2019s claim for depreciation on said payment wasto be allowed.[Principal CIT v Swastik Industries (2016) 240 Taxman 510 (Guj)] \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019441 \nThe consideration paid by the assessee in excess of value of tangible assets was to beclassified as goodwill especially in the case where the transaction in question was aslump sale which did not contemplate separate values to be ascribed to various assets{tangible and intangibie).

It was held:\n(i)that registration under the Motor Vehicles Act was not an essential pre-requisitefor the acquisition of the ownership of the motor vehicles but was only anobligation cast upon an owner of the vehicle for the purpose of running thevehiclesin any public place. As the registration of the vehicles could not bemade in the name of the firm; the registration continued in the names of the threepartners who initially owned the vehicles.\n(i)that the expression \u2018owned by the assessee\u2019 in section 32 of the Act had not beenused in the sense of the property, complete title in which vested in the assessee.The assessee would be considered to be an owner under section 32 if he was in aposition to exercise the rights of an owner not on behalf of the person in whomthe title vested, but in his own right.\n(iii)That, therefore, the Tribunal was right in holding that the assessee owned andused the three vehicles and was entitled in depreciation under section 32 of theAct [CIT v Navdurga Transport Co.

Where the assessee was a partnership firm, but theownership of the machinery, etc of the mill vested in two of its parmers, who had,however, allowed the use of machinery, etc of the mill to the assessee, it was heldthat the assessee firm was not entitled to depreciation allowance in respect ofmachinery, etc, as the ownership of the assets continue to vest with partners only andfurther, that the question of distributing the depreciation allowance equally betweenthe two partners could not also arise. It was pointed out that it was the firm whichwas the assessee and the depreciation allowance had therefore to be allowed ordisallowed with respect to the assessee-firm [CIT v Bordubi Rice, Flour & Oil Mills(1976) 105 ITR 739 (Gau)].\nPartner not entitled to depreciation on his asset if used by firm: Assessee is notentitled to depreciation on factory building owned by it but used in business of firm\nin which assessee was partner.

Buses were initially purchased by the directors of the assessee-company and thefinance was raised by them from bankers in their individual names. However, thebuses were taken over by the assessee by resolution dated October 30, 1988. Theincome of the said buses was shown and assessed in the hands of the assessee-company and the expenses relating to these buses on account of interest paid to thebank, insurance, hire purchase charges and salaries to the drivers were also beingclaimed asa deduction by the assessee-company. The costs of the buses werereflected in the balance-sheet of the company and the liability towards \u2018the bankagainst these buses on account of \u2018term joan\u2019 was also reflected under the head\u2018Secured loans\u2019. The Assessing Officer refused to allow depreciation on the buses in\nthe hands of the company. The Tribunai concluded that there was ample evidence onrecord to show that the assessee had taken over the buses from the directors and themere fact that they were not got registered in the names of the assessee could not be\na ground for disallowing the claim of depreciation. The assessee was entitled todepreciation on the buses which were standing in the names of the directors [CIT vFazilka Dabwali TPT. Co. Pvt. Ltd (2004) 270 ITR 398 (P&H)j.\n2. However, where an assessee company claim depreciation on vehicle purchased inname of director and finding of the authorities were that the assessee company hadno dominion over vehicle and there was no material to show use of vehicle for thepurpose of the business of the assessee company, it was held that the ownership of anasset in his personal capacity by the director of the company cannot be an assetdeemed to be in the vested ownership or beneficial utility of the company. They weretwo distinct and independent legal entities. This was not a question of law, but wasprimarily a question of fact. All the three authorities had given additional reasons forrejecting the claim of depreciation. No records were produced by the assessee toshow that the utility of the vehicle was in the normal course for the benefit of thecompany. In fact, according to the findings recorded by the Tribunal, even beneficial \n446A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nownership did not vest in the assessee-company. There was no reason to disturb theconcurrent view taken by the authorities [AZ.M. Fisheries Pvt. Lid v CIT (2005) 277ITR 204 (Del)].\n3. Vehicles though registered in the names of the directors were used for the purposeof business of the company, company entitled to claim depreciation. The Court heldthat the assessee is not entitled to higher rate of depreciation when the assessee hadgiven vehicles on lease [C/T v Aravali Finlease Lid. (2012) 341 ITR 282 (Gu)j)].\n4.

In fact,even prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in Mysore Minerals\u2019 case, the HighCourts in the case of vehicles had uniformly taken the view that registration underMotor Vehicles Act does not confer any title and that registration certificate notbeing a document of title, depreciation could not be refused [C7T v Salkia TransportAssociates (1983) 143 ITR 39 (Cal); CIT v Amber Corporation (1981) 127 ITR 29(Raj) again which SLP was refused (1983) 142 ITR (St.) 6; CIT v Royal AmberResorts (1987) 164 ITR 311 (Raj); C22\u2019 v Nidish Transport Corpn (1990) 185 ITR669 (Ker); CIT\u2019 v Basti Sugar Mills Co Lid (2002) 257 ITR 88 (Del)].",

For tax purposes, only the owner is entitled for depreciation. Merecapitalization according to AS-19 will have no implication on the allowance ofdepreciation on assets under the provisions of the Income-tax Act (Circular No. 2,dated 9.2.2001). However, if lessee (in case of financial lease) can exercise the rightof the owner not behalf of lessor but in his own right, depreciation is available to theassessee. Conversely, if there is a very specific stipulation in lease agreement that ontermination of lease, leased plant and machinery will have to be returned to lessor inthe same Condition in which they were taken except normal wear and tear, it cannotbe said to be a financial lease, it is case of operating lease and the lessor in this case\nshall be entitled to depreciation on leased assets [CIT v Shree Rajasthan Syntex Ltd\n_ (2008) 217 CTR (Raj) 209: (2009) 178 Taxman 33 (Raj)].\nAssessee carrying on business of leasing is entitled to claim the depreciation, as soon\nas the machinery is leased and the lease rent is received, whether the lessee hasinstalled the machinery or not is immaterial [CIT v Kotak Mahindra Finance Lid.(2010) 191 Taxman 280 (Bom)].\nWhen leased assets are installed at place of lessee, it could be presumed for purposeof depreciation that they had been used by lessee, hence, for allowability ofdepreciation actual date on which such assets were put to use by lessee has norelevance oad v Sundaram Finance\u2019 Ltd.. (2012) 205 Taxman 37: 67 DTR 117(Mad)].\nSection 32 provides that the asset must be \u201cowned, wholly or partly, by the assessee\n. and used for the purposes of the business\".It imposesa twin requirement of\n\"ownership\" and \"usage for business\" for a successful claim under section 32. Thesection requires that the assessee must use the asset for the \"purposes of business\". Itdoes not mandate usage of the asset by the assessee itself. As long as the asset isutilized for the purpose of business of the assessee, the requirement of section 32 willstand satisfied, notwithstanding non-usage of the asset itself by the assessee. In this \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019449 \ncase, the assessee wasa leasing company which leased out the trucks thatitpurchased. The income derived from leasing of the trucks was business income orincome derived in the course of business and had been so assessed. The assessee wasentitled to depreciation on the leasing of trucks.

        "content": "6.119Can depreciation be claimed on assets taken on hire purchase?\nAns.Whether the assessee is the owner of the property obtained under a hire purchaseagreement would depend on the terms and conditions of such agreement [SardarTara Singh v CIT (1963) 47 ITR 756 (MP).\nDepreciation in Hire Purchase Transactions: Where the assessee acquires an assetunder hire purchase agreement, which has a term treating the financier as the owner,depreciation is not admissible to the user on such assets. It was so held in Atlas CycleIndustries Lid v CIT (2004) 270 ITR 108 (P&H). However, courts have also foundthat notwithstanding the form in which the agreement is worded, the substance of theagreement could be different, when for example, it is found that in case of hire-purchase agreement in truck financing, it is the truck operator, who is entitled todepreciation with the form of hire purchase agreement being understood as one forbetter security for the financier without any intention to hold title over the property.\nIt is for this reason that even registration certificate in case of motor vehicles has notbeen considered as document of title, so that the ownership is ordinarily determinedwith reference to the law relating to movable property, where there is transfer ofownership when the consideration is paid and delivery is taken. \n450A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nIn the case of hire purchase agreement, the ownership would depend upon the terms\nof the agreement which has to be produced before the Assessing Officer to obtainallowance in respect of depreciation of assets purchased on hire-purchase basis [C/T(Addl) v General Industries Corpn (1985) 155 IFR 430 (Del); CIT v Nagpur GoldenTransport Co. (1998) 233 ITR 389 (Del); Chaganlal Automobiles v CIT (1985) 156ITR58(Raj);Srinivasamurthy(YV)v.CIT(1967)64ITR292(Mys);Srirangacharyulu (SPBP) v CIT (1965) 58 ITR 95 (AP); Sardar Tara Singh v CIT(1963) 47 ITR 756 (MP); Tirrihannah Co Ltd v CIT (2002) 253 ITR (AT) 56 (Cal-Trib)].\nConsequently, if the following conditions are satisfied, the depreciationcan beclaimed by the hirer:\n(i)The hire purchase agreement must show that as long as hirer discharges hisobligation, he has an uninterrupted right over the asset for all practical purposes.\n(ii)The seller will eventually lose all right, title and interest in the asset if the hirerdischarges his obligation of payment of all instalments.\nFurther, Circular No. 9, dated 23-3-1943 (reiterated vide Instruction No. 1079, dated19-9-1977) has been issued by the CBDT for allowing depreciation in the case ofassets owned under hire-purchase agreements:\n(1)In every case of payment purporting to be for hire-purchase, production of theagreement under which the payment is made should be insisted on.\n(2)Where the effect of an agreement is that the ownership of the subject is at oncetransferred to the lessee (eg where the lessor obtains a right to sue for arrearinstalments but no right to recovery of the asset), the transaction should beregarded as one of the purchase by instalments and no deduction in respect ofhire should be made. Depreciation should be allowed to the lessee on the entirepurchase price as per agreement.\n(3)Where the terms of the agreement provide that the equipment shall eventuallybecome the property of the hirer or confer on the hirer an option to purchase theequipment, the transaction should be regarded as one of hire-purchase. In suchcases the periodical payments made by the hirer should for tax purposes beregarded as made up of:\n(a)consideration for hire, to be allowed as a deduction in the assessment, and\n(b)payment on account of purchase to be treated as capital outlay, depreciationbeing allowed to the lessee on the initial value (eg the amount for which thehired subject would have been sold for cash at the date of agreement).\n(4)The allowance to be made in respect of hire should be the difference between theaggregate amount of the periodical payments under the agreement and the initialvalue (as described above), the amount of this allowance being spread evenlyover the term of the agreement. If, however, the agreement was terminated eitherby the outright purchase of equipment or of its return to the owner, the deductionshould cease as from the date of the termination. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019451 \n(5)An assessee claiming this deduction should be asked to furnish a certificate, fromthe vendor or other satisfactory evidence, of the initial value (as describedabove). Where no certificate or satisfactory evidence is forthcoming, the initialvalue should be arrived at by computing the present value of the amount payableunder the agreement at an appropriate rate per centum; in doubtful cases the factsshould be reported to the Board.\nThus in case of hire purchase agreement of the nature mentioned in para (3) of theabove circular, depreciation will be allowed on the cash down price of the asset and\nthe interest charges be treated as consideration for hire and allowed as a deduction.\nHirer of an asset under hire purchase agreement is entitled to depreciation in view ofthe CBDT Circular No. 9 dated 23-3-1943 [CIT v Kaveri Engineering Industries(2011) 53 DTR 102 (Mad)).\nWhere under the agreement, the machinery is to become the property of the assesseeon payment of entire price of hire purchase on the expiry of 3 years and the entireprice is not so paid, depreciation would not be allowable to the assessee in respect ofthe machinery [Chaganial Automobiles v CIT (1985) 156 ITR 58 (Raj)].\nHowever, where these were no such agreement and the trucks were purchased onhire purchase basis, the assessee was held to be owner thereof and was alloweddepreciation [C/T v Nagpur Golden Transport Co. (1998) 233 ITR 389 (el)].\nIt may be noted that in case of hire purchase, depreciation can be claimed bycapitalizing the value equivalent to cash price of such asset and the remainingamount payable can be claimed as hire charges during the period of contract.Whereas in the case of instalment purchase, the amount agreed to be paid as price forthe asset can be capitalized for depreciation.",

J\u00e9 is the control which determines who is using it.Use means not only getting benefit but also controlling, running, stopping, repairing,replacing, etc.\n-An owner of buildings, machinery, plant or furniture does not cease to be entitled todepreciation merely because he has let the same for user by a lessee.

        "content": "6.124Is depreciation eligible on passive use of the assets?\nAns.Active and Passive user: The concept of use of an asset was always considered toinclude active as well as passive use. Thus even if an asset has not been actually usedbut kept ready for use for the purpose of business or profession during any previousyear, the assessee was entitled to claim depreciation with respect to such asset.However, a contrary judgement has been given by the Bombay High Court in thecase of Dinesh Kumar Gulab Chand Agarwal and the Karnataka High Court in thecase of Yellamma Dasappa Hospital see below,\nThe user of the asset should be understood in a wide sense as to embrace passive aswell as active user. If a machine is kept ready for use at any moment in a particularfactory, under an express agreement from which taxable profits are earned, themachinery can be said to be used for the purpose of the business which eamedprofits, although in fact it was not worked during the year [Capital Bus Service (P)Lid (1980) 123 ITR 404 (Del). Also see Whittle Anderson Lid v CIT (1971) 79 ITR613 (Bom)}.\nWhere standby piants,to provide against breakdownor any other unforeseencircumstance, manufacturing concerns have to be kept in readiness, these plants alsowould qualify for full depreciation, though they have not been actively used inbusiness during the previous year, as, for example, additional boiler in all factoriesdriven by steam power; standby generator of an electric supply company. So also,where a transport operator has to and does keep certain spare buses ready and in a fitcondition to ply on the road, they can be said to be used for the business though due\nto lack of enough contracts or for the other reason those buses did not have to beactually operated on the routes during the previous year [Capital Bus Service (P) Ltd(1980) 123 ITR 404 (Del)].\nSimilarly, the Kerala High Court in C/T v Geo Tech Construction Corporation(2000) 244 ITR 452 (Ker) found that an asset which is kept ready for use is alsoeligible for depreciation.\nWhere spare engines, by a transport company, were kept in the store, these could besaid to be meant for use and hence eligible for depreciation [C/T v Pepsu RoadTransport Corpn. (2002) 253 ITR 303 (P&H)].\nDepreciation allowable where plant ready for use: Assessee company was entitleddepreciation in respect of gas sweetening plant which was kept ready for use butcould not be actually used due to lack of availability of raw material during relevantassessment years [ACIT v Chennai Petroleum Corporation (2010) 125 ITD 396(Chennai)(TM)}. \n454\nA Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nHowever, a contrary view has been taken in the case of Dinesh Kumar GulabchandAgrawal v CIT (2004) 267 ITR 769 (Bom) where it was held that the expression usedmeans actually used for the purpose of the business and not merely ready for use.Hence, depreciation shall not be allowed unless the asset is actually used for thebusiness. It may be noted that in this case special leave petition filed by the assessee\nin the Supreme Court has been dismissed.\nFurther, the Karnataka High Court has also held that kept ready theoryis notworkable for depreciation benefit. The machinery and other assets must be actuallyused to claim depreciation under section 32 [Dy CIT v Yellamma Dasappan Hospital(2007) 159 Taxman 58 (Karn)}.\n \nIt may be mentioned after the above judgements, several High Court have againtaken a view that passive use of assets is entitled to depreciation.\nThe assessee used machinery during preceding two years but could not use duringrelevant year on account of non-receipt of orders. It was held that the assessee isentitled to depreciation [C77 v Nahar Exports Ltd (2008) 296 ITR 419 (P&H)].\nSo long as assessee's business was a going concern and plant got ready for use but\u2018due to non availability of raw-material it could not be put to use, said fact could notstand in way of granting claim under section 32. [CIT v Chennai Petroleum Corpn.Ltd, (2013) 218 Taxman 228 (Mad)]. \nFrom the above, it may be pointed out the concept of passive use or potential useshould be applied only in the case of stand by assets. In all other case, it should beestablished that the asset is actually put to use during the previous year.\n ",

It would include use by the employees and others which is subservient toand necessary for the purposes of the business carried on by the assessee. Thus, if acompany carrying on business constructs residential quarters for its employees, theproperty could not be said to be used by the company for the purposes of its businessand the company would be entitled to depreciation thereon, if the occupation of theproperty by the employees is subservient to and necessary for the purpose of theirduties. The same would be the position in regard to the other assets like air-conditioners, electric fans, etc, given by the employer for the personal use of theemployees or directors at their residences and the employer would be entitled todepreciation in respect of such assets [Circular No. 10/14/66-IT-(A1), dated 12-12-1966].\nSince workers\u2019 quarters were let out as a part of plant and income so derived wasassessed \u2018as business income, claim for depreciation had nexus with the business ofassessee and therefore depreciation is to be allowed [C/T v Rieta Biscuit Co.

[Khinji Visram & Sons (Guj) P.

There is nothing in the new provisions tointerpret that the use of individual asset is a requirement of law for claiming thedepreciation. The effect of new provisions is that in case of a running concern, theindividual working of the machinery is not necessitated as the new asset falling with\nthe block gets added to the written down value of the block. [Nathani Steels Lid vDCIT (1996) 56 TTI 240 (Bom)].\nBoth ownership and use are required for the purposes of depreciation, though afterthe adoption of the concept of block depreciation, the user test will be relevant only\nin the year of entry into the block, because onceit enters the block,it is neitherpossible nor necessary to consider, whether each asset in the block has been usedduring the year. [DCIT v Udaipur Distillery Co Lid. (2001)119 Taxman 206(Jodh.Mag.): 01) 119 Taxman 206 (Jodh.Mag.).\nOnce an asset is part of a block of assets and depreciation is granted on that block, itcannot be denied in the subsequent year on the ground that one of the assets is notused by the assessee in some of years. User of asset has to apply on block as a wholeinstead of an individual asset [Unitex Products Ltd v ITO (2008) 22 SOT 430 \n456A Compendium of Issues on income Tax \n(Mum). Also see DCIT v Coromandal Bio Tech Industries (1) Ltd. (2012) 51 SOT333 (Hyd)(Trib)].\nDepreciation has to be allowed on block of assets and not on single asset. Thus,whether an asset which forms part of block is used during the previous year or notshall not have any impact on the amount of depreciation allowable as deductionunder the Income Tax Act. [Commissioner of Income-tax \u2014IV v Vallbh Glass Works\n_ Ltd, (2013)-38 texmann.com 177 (Guj): (2014) 220 Taxman 129 (Guj)(MAG.)}\n' Assessee-company did not do any hotel business after its hotel building was washed\naway in floods in September, 1995. However, assesse-company being a juristic entityincorporated under the Companies Act, did not cease to exist. Since it has to fulfill\nits obligations imposed by Companies Act till it is wound up, some staff has to bemaintained. Therefore, once the assessee company is in existence, it is entitled todepreciation thoughit has discontinued its business [CZ7T vy Kirti Resorts (P) Lid(2011) 60 DTR 138: 243 CTR (HP) 341].\nNon user of asset forming block of assets does not disentitle depreciation: Theassessee claimed depreciation under section 32 in respect of the assets at its Bhopal\nunit which was closed for six years. The claim was on the basis that (1) despiteclosure of the unit there was a \"passive user\" of the asset were part of the \"Block ofassets\", depreciation could not be disallowed.

See also NinnaCredit & Capital Ltd. v ACIT (2017) 82 taxmann.com 109 (Guj):(2027) 390 ITR 302(Guj)]\nWhere the contention of the revenue was that in respect to any machinery for whichdepreciation is claimed under section 32, the same cannot be allowed unless suchmachinery is used in the business and since discarded machinery is not used in thebusiness, therefore with respect to discarded machinery no depreciation can beallowed, it was held that as long as the machineryis available for use though notactually used, it falls within the expression used for the purpose of the business andthe assessee can claim the benefit of depreciation after reducing the scrap value ofthe assets which have been discarded and written off in the books of account for theyear under consideration from the written down value of the block of assets [C/T vYamaha Motor India (P) Lid 226 CTR. 304 (Del)]. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019457 \nDepreciation is not allowable in respect of machineries which have been discardeddue to obsolescence and which have not been used in manufacturing of product [CIT\nv Luwa India Lid (2012) 205 Taxman 342 (Kam)].\nDepreciation on damaged machinery forming part of block: Damaged machinery isalso entitied to depreciation because a particular plant or machinery loses its identityonce it enters the block [South Eastern Coalfields Lid v Jt.

In order words, it is not necessary\nthat the asset should have been used for the purpose of business or professionthroughout the previous year. Even user during any part of the year would besufficient to enable the assessee to claim depreciation for the whole year.\n(ii)Asset acquired and put to use during the same previous year for less than 180days: Where any asset falling within a block of assets is acquired by the assesseeduring the previous year and. is put to use for the purposes of business orprofession for a period of less than one hundred and eighty days in that previousyear, the deduction for depreciation in respect of such asset shall be restricted tofifty per cent of the amount calculated at the percentage prescribed in the case ofblock of assets comprising such asset. With the block depreciation the concept ofuse should be relevant only for the first year so that when the asset is brought touse it enters the block, while for the subsequent year the identity of any asset inthe block is lost so that if the block itself is used depreciation should beadmissible for the entire block. But in the year in which plant or machinery isacquired, the date of such acquisition would be relevant, so that the depreciation\nfor that additional asset in an existing block will have to be calculated separately\nfor purposes of arriving at 50% or 100% depending upon whether it is acquired\nin first or later part of the year.\n(b) Partial user as regards purpose\nThe user of an asset may also be partial in that the asset is used only in part for thepurposes of the business and in part for other purposes. Such a situation is provided \n458A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nfor by section 38(2) which states that where any building, machinery or plant has notbeen used by the assessee exclusively for the purpose of his business then thededuction on account of depreciation shall be allowed proportionately.\nWhere the assessee occupied five floors of a building comprising of six floors ownedbyit, depreciation was allowable only on five-sixths of the building and not theentire building [Punjab National Bank Lid v CIT (1983) 141 ITR 886 (Del)].\nFull depreciation allowed even if plant and machinery is also being used by theassociate concern: Mere fact that the assessee has allowed use of its machine to itsassociates does not render the assessee ineligibleto claim thefull extent ofdepreciation in relation to that machine as the investment and ownership of themachine was exclusively that of the assessee [CIT v Indian Express (Madurai)(2002) 255 ITR 68 (Mad)].\n ",

Sub-clause (6) of clause (6) of section 43 provides that WDV in the case of assetsacquired before the previous year shall be computed by taking the actual cost to theassessee less all depreciation \u2018actually allowed\u2019 to him under the Income-tax Act.\nRules 7A, 7B and 8 of the Income tax Rules, 1962, deal with the computation ofcomposite income where income is derived in part from agricultural operations and\nin part from business chargeable to tax under the Income tax Act, 1961 under thehead \u2018Profits & Gains of Business\u2019. These rules prescribe the method of computation\nin the case of manufacture of rubber, coffee and tea. In such cases, the income which\nis brought to tax as \u2018business income\u2019isa prescribed fixed percentage of thecomposite income.\nThe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT v Doom Dooma India Ltd 222 CTR(SC) 105 has held that in view of the language employed in sub-clause (5) of clause\n(6) of section 43 regarding depreciation \u2018actually allowed\u2019, where any income ispartially agricultural and partially chargeable to tax under the Income-tax Act, 1961under the head \u2018Profits & Gains of Business\u2019, the depreciation deducted in arriving atthe taxable income alone can be taken into account for computing the WDV in thesubsequent year.\nFor instance, rule 8 prescribes the taxability of income from the manufacture of tea.Under the said rule, income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by\nseller shall be computed as if it were income derived from business, and 40% of such \n466A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nincome shall be deemed to be income liable to tax. As a result of the Court decision,the resultant computation of depreciation is as per the following illustration:\n@\u00ae)Sale proceeds of tea1,000Less: Expenses:\n|Depreciation \u2014 (10% of \u20ac1,000)(100)Others expenses(300)Composite income600Income subject to charge under the Income-tax Act, 1961by application of rule 8 (40% of 600)240Income not chargeable to income-tax (60% of 600)360\nAccording to the interpretation of the Court, the W.D.V. of the fixed asset for theimmediately succeeding year is to be takenat %960 (%1,000 minus 240 beingdepreciation allocated for business income) and not 7900 (%1,000 minus depreciationof %100 allowed for determining composite income). Thus the depreciation for whichdeduction is allowed to the assessee while computing its agricultural income is to be\u2018ignored for computing the W.D.V. of the asset according to the Court ruling.\nThe above interpretation is not in accordance with the legislative intent. WDV isrequired to be computed by deducting the full depreciation attributable to compositeincome. Hencein the above illustration,the WDV of the fixedassetfor theimmediately succeeding year is to be taken at 2900 and not 960 as held by theSupreme Court. The ambiguity in this case has arisen on account of the interpretationof the meaning of the phrase \u2018actually allowed\u2019 in sub-clause (d) of clause (6) ofsection 43.\nTherefore Explanation 7 has been inserted in section 43(6) to provide that where theincome of an assessee is derived, in part from agriculture and in part from businesschargeableto mcome-taxunderthe head\u2018Profitsandgainsof businessorprofession\u2019, for computing the written down value of assets acquired before theprevious year, the total amount of depreciation shall be computed as if the entireincome is derived from the business of the assessee under the head \u2018Profits and gainsof business or profession\u2019 and the depreciation so computed shall be deemed to bethe depreciation actually allowed under this Act.",

It is for this reason that all those expenses relating to erectionwould require to be capitalised. However, such capitalisation should accord withaccounting principles. A publication by the Institute of Chartered Accounts of India\u2018Guidance Noteon Treatment of Expenditure during Construction Period\u2019 andAccounting Standards 6 and 10 should offer necessary guidelines for capitalisation inhaving it accepted.\nActual cost to include all expenditure necessary to bring such asset into existenceand to put that in working condition: The Supreme Court held in Challapaili SugarsLid v CIT (1975) 98 ITR 167 (SC) that the term actual cost should be construed inthe sense which no commercial man would misunderstand and that the accepted rulesof accountancy should be adopted for determining the actual cost. The acceptedaccountancy rule is to include all expenditure necessary to bring such assets intoexistence and to put them in working condition and it is wholly irrelevant whetherthe asset was acquired prior to the commencement of the business or subsequent tosuch commencement.\nThe cost of an asset to be calculated for the purpose of allowing depreciation, etc, isthe cost to the assessee and not to the person who makes the sale of the asset to theassessee [CIT v Buckingham & Carnatic Co.

Thisdecision was based on the following reasoning:\n\u201cIn case money is borrowed by a newly-started company which is in the process ofconstructing and erecting its plant, the interest incurred before the commencement ofproduction on such borrowed money can be capitalised and added to the cost of thefixed assets created as a result of such expenditure.

For making such adjustment the actual costimplies the actual cost less depreciation allowance till date.\nWhere a capital asset has been acquired from a foreign country, the addition ordeduction from the actual cost of the asset on account of change in the rate ofexchange in any previous year shall be allowed to be made only on actual payment\nby the assessee towards the cost of the asset or repayment of the foreign loan orinterest, irrespective of the method of accounting adopted by the assessee.\nHowever, where an addition to or deduction from the actual cost or expenditure orcost of acquisition has been made under this section, as it stood immediately before\nits substitution by the Finance Act, 2002, on account of an increase or reduction in\nthe liability as aforesaid, the amount to be added to, or, as the case may be, deductedunder this section from, the actual cost or expenditure or cost of acquisition at the\n_ time of making the payment shall be so adjusted that the total amount added to, or, as\nthe case may be, deducted from, the actual cost or expenditure or cost of acquisition,\nis equal to the increase or reduction in the aforesaid liability taken into account at thetime of making payment.\nIncrease/decrease in liability at the time of payment has to be adjusted from actualcost of the asset. As per Supreme Court, actual cost referred to in section 43A should \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019477\n \nbe read as \u2018actual cost minus depreciation allowed till date\u2019 [C77 v Arvind Mills Ltd(1992) 193 ITR 255 (SC)].\nWhere the foreign exchange contracts were made by the assessee for the purpose ofacquiring capital assets and the forward contracts were settled during previous yearrelevant to the assessment year under appeal, the claim of the assessee to adjust the\nloss on settlement being legitimate, the said loss needs to be added to the cost of theconcerned capital assets as per section 43A, and consequently, depreciation is to beallowed on the enhanced value of the capital assets. ASW Steel Lid v ACIT (2010) 46DTR 41: 133 TTJ 742 (Bang)(Trib)].\nThe Supreme Court has held that depreciation on cost enhanced by capitalisation offoreign exchange loss was deductible.

In this case the Assessing Officer is entitled to estimate actualcost of the asset at [120,000 if he is satisfied the main purpose of transfer was thereduction of tax liability of G. However, in this case, he has to take prior approval of \n480A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nthe Joint Commissioner. However R will have to pay capital gain tax on suchtransfer and consideration price for this transfer shall remain at \u00a5300,000. \nJt may be observed that such asset acquired by the assessee must have been usedby some other person any time for the purpose of his business and profession. Ifthe asset was used by. such other person for his personal purposes earlier,Explanation 3 cannot be invoked eg in the above case, if the asset was never usedby R in the past for his business and profession, then the Assessing Officer in thatcase cannot assume %120,000 as the actual cost of that asset to G, It will be%300,000 (ie the transfer price) in this case and R will have to pay capital gain onsuch transfer by taking the consideration price of $300,000,\nAt the same time, unless the Assessing Officer, after giving the assessee anopportunity to establish the genuineness of the transfer, is objectively satisfied thatthe acquisition of assets involved a transfer for the purpose of reduction of tax\nliability, depreciation on the acquired assets has to be allowed on the actual pricepaid for them by the assessee. Such objective satisfaction should not be inferred fromthe mere fact that the Assessing Officer had obtained the approval of the DeputyCommissioner (now Joint Commissioner)to have recourse to these provisions[Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd v CIT (1973) Tax LR 1336 {Ail)].\nExplanation 3 to section 43 does not require determination of market value at thehands of the Assessing Officer but speaks of determination of actual cost by theAssessing Officer with the prior approval of the Deputy Commissioner (now JointCommissioner) having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

If the Assessing Officer does not even attempt to state that the valuationreport and the values put on the assets are incorrect in any manner whatsoever, andsimply ignore the valuation report. They cannot substitute a lower value to be thecost of the asset [Ashwin Vanaspati Industries v CIT (2002) 255 ITR 26 (Gu)j)].\nWhere a second hand asset is acquired from a person who has not used the asset for\nthe purpose of his business and profession, it was held that provisions of Explanation\n3 to section 43(1) are not applicable.

[C/T v SandvikChokshi Ltd.

The Tribunal confirmed theconcurrent finding of the Assessing Officer and Commissioner (Appeals) in the lightof the specific provision under Explanation 3 to section 43(1), which empowers theAssessing Officer to determine the actual cost differently from the one claimed bythe assessee, if the main purpose of the transfer is to claim higher depreciation onenhanced cost. The claim that the transfer was prompted by business motive wasfound unacceptable, because the company had become a partner only 13 monthsearlier and the other partners of the firm had interest both in the firm and thecompany.

Chemicals Ltd (1994) 210 ITR 830 (SC),where it was held that subsidy granted by the Government as an incentive for settingup Industries in backward area at a percentage of cost of capital assets is not apayment for meeting any portion of the cost of the capital assets with in thecontemplation of section 43(1) of Income-tax Act, 196land the same is not to bededucted in computation of actual cost of the assets for the purpose of grant ofdepreciation allowance, etc \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019491 \nExplanation 10 to section 43(1) does not cover the case of waiver of the joan. Itcovers only the grant of a subsidy or reimbursement by whatever name called.Though the assessee's case may not fall under Explanation 10, the waiver of the loanamounted to the meeting of a portion of the cost of the assets under the mainprovision of section 43(1) because of the treatment given by the assessee in its booksof account in reducing the cost/WDV of the assets by the amount of the loanswaived, The real nature of a transaction can be understood by reference to thecontemporaneous act of the parties, which throws considerable light on their trueintention and their understanding of the transaction. The assessee understood thereceipt of the loans as having been given towards meeting a part of the cost of theassets and the waiver cannot have a different effect on such intention. It was furtherheld that PJ Chemicals Ltd (1994) 210 ITR 830 (SC), which holds, (pre Explanation\n10) that a subsidy given as an incentive for industrial growth cannot be reduced fromthe cost of the assets under section 43(1), does not apply to the facts [Steel Authorityof India Lid v CIT (2012) 206 Taxman 574 (Del)].",

Hence, the asset falling in a block of assetswhich belong to a division or unit sold off by assessee would not be deemed tobelong to a separate block of assets for application of section 50 [C77 v Ansal \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019495 \nProperties & Infrastructure Lid.

Nowhere is it mentioned in section 50 that\nthe sale consideration is to be deducted from the written down value of that particularasset.

The exercise may be \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019503\ntime-consuming or difficult but it cannot be said that in the changed scheme ofthings,disallowanceundersection38(2)isnotcapableof computation.Difficulties apart, the disallowance under section 38(2) is certainly capable ofcomputation.\u2019\nThis view was endorsed by the Special Bench in Gulati Saree Centre v ACIT (1999)240 ITR (AT) (Chand)(SB) holding that the provisions of section 43(6)(c) andsection 50(2) do not interfere with the applicability of section 38(2).\nThe other view taken by the Tribunal earlier that in the scheme of block depreciation,the test of user has to be applied for the block as a whole and not for each individualasset [Packwell Printers v ACIT (1996) 59 ITD 340 (Jab)].

        "content": "6.254What are the conditions to be satisfied for claiming deduction under section36(1)(\u00e9z) in respect of interest on borrowed capital?\nAns.As per the Supreme Court in the case of Madhav Prasad Jatia vy CIT (1 979) 118 ITR200 (SC) for claiming deductions under this sub-clause, the basic requirements are:\n(A)The money ie (capital) must have been borrowed by the assessee: if interest ispaid, not on capital borrowed but for part consideration remaining unpaid onacquisition of a business, section 36(#i?) will have no application but the samemay fall under section 37(1);\nFurther for a loan there has to be a positive act of lending money coupled withacceptance of it by the other side [CEPT v Bhartia Electric Steel Co. Ltd (1954)25 ITR 192 (Cal)].\nAn element of refund or repayment is inherent in the concept of borrowing [CIT\n_v Bazpur Co-operative Sugar Factory Ltd (1989) 177 ITR 469 (SC)].\nHowever, in certain circumstances, it is possible to infer a borrowing. It was heldby the Supreme Court in Lakshmanier and Sons v CIT (1953) 23 ITR 202 (SC)that cash security deposits carrying. interest, maintained with the assessee, a millagent, by his customers for the due fulfilment by the latter of their contracts forpurchase of mill yarn was money borrowed by the assessee.\nThe borrowing may be on a permanent footing such as by way of debenture loan\nor a spasmodic one such as from year to year, or for short terms such as by wayof overdrafts from banks, or loans from time to time [india Cement Lid v CIT(1966) 60 ITR 52 (SC)].\nBorrowing by one unit of a concern from another unit was not capital borrowed[Malwa Mills Karamchari Paraspar Shakskari Sanstha Lid v CIT (1983) 140ITR 379 (MP)).\n'(B)It must have been borrowed by the assessee for the purpose of his business,profession or vocation; and\n(C)Assessee must have paid interest on the borrowing: Interest is a permissiblededuction under this clause only if it has been paid. Paid as already explained,means actually paid or due, depending upon the method of accounting employedby the assessee. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Prafession\u2019571 \nFurther, the interest need not have been actually paid in cash. It may have beenpaid by way of adjustment in accounts by any equivalent mode when theaccounts are maintained on the mercantile basis. Under the mercantile system, aliability for the interest must have accrued during the previous year. However,where the amount payable by the assessee to the creditor is itself a matter indispute and interest is directed to be paid by an award, it has been held that theliability for interest accrued in the previous year in which the award is given(CIT v Roberts McLean & Co, Lid (1978) 111 ITR 489 (Cal)]. \n1.Interest to financial institutions and interest on term-loan from a scheduledbank, is allowed as deduction subject to provisions of section 43B.\n2.While interest on a capital borrowing is deductible under this clause, anybrokerage or commission given to an agent to procure the loan would bedeductible under the provisions of section 37(1).\n3.As per section 40(a)() interest paid outside India is not allowable as deductionunless tax has been paid/deducted at source. Similarly, as per section 40(a)(ia)interest payable to a resident shall not be allowed as deduction unless the taxhas been deducted and paid within the time allowed.\n 4.While interest ona capital borrowingis deductible under this clause, anybrokerage or commission given to an agent to procure the loan would bedeductible under the provisions of section 37(1).",

In that view of the matter,the interest paid on borrowings for the purposes of the coal mining business, whichwas subsequently nationalised, has been held allowable from the profits of the boringbusiness which was continued to be carried on even after nationalisation of minesbecause the mining business and the boring business constituted the same business[CIT v Western Bengal Coal Fields Ltd (1998) 233 ITR 139 (Cal)}. \n572 A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax",

        "content": "6.265What is the treatment of employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s contribution to ProvidentFund, ESI and other approved Welfare Funds of the employee\u2019s?\nAns.Upto assessment year 2003-04, employer\u2019s contribution to provident fund, ESI andother approved welfare funds of the employees was allowed as a deduction onlywhen the payment of same was made on or before the due date prescribed under therespective Acts, ie Provident Fund Act, ESI Act, etc If the payment was made aftersuch dateit was never allowed as a deduction. Further, if the payment of suchamount was made by cheque, the deduction was allowed only if the cheque wasencashed within 15 days of such due date.\nThe Finance Act, 2003 has omitted the above provisions contained in the secondproviso to section 43B. Henceforth, like ali other items covered under section 43B,employer\u2019s contribution to PF, ESI, etc shall be allowed as a deduction on due basis\nif the payment of same is made on or before the due date of furnishing the return ofincome prescribed under section 139(1). However, if the payment of such sum ismade subsequent to the due date, like any other item covered under section 43B, it\nshall be allowed as a deduction in the year in which it is paid. The condition ofencashment of cheque within 15 days has also been withdrawn.\nIs the omission of the second proviso to section 43B effective retrospectively: Theissue for consideration is whether the omission of the proviso w.e.f. assessment year2004-05 is having a retrospective effect and the contribution to RPF made before the \n582A Compendiumof Issues on Income Tax \ndue date for filing of return can be claimed as deduction even for the assessmentyears prior to A-Y. 2004-05.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Alom Extrusion Lid has held that omission ofsecond proviso to section 43B and the amendment of first proviso by Finance Act,2003, bringing about uniformity in payment of tax, duty, cess and fee on one handand contributions to employees welfare funds on the other are curative in nature andthus effective retrospectively w.e.f. 1st April, 1988. ie, the date of insertion of firstproviso [CIT v Alom Extrusions Lid (2009) 319 ITR 306 (SC)).\nHence, the issue stands resolved that omission has a retrospective application.\nAs regards employees\u2019 contribution to provident fund, ESI or other approved welfarefund of the employee, the provisions are as under:\nAs per section 2(24)(x), any sum deducted from the salary of the employee as hiscontribution to any provident fund or superannuation fund or ESI or any otherapproved welfare fund of such employee shall be treated as an income of theemployer. However, if such contribution is actually paid on or before the due datementioned below, the deduction will be allowed for the same.\n\u201cDue date\u2019 means the date by which the assessee is required as an employer to creditan employee\u2019s contribution to the employee\u2019s account in the relevant fund under anyAct, rule, order or notification issued thereunder or under any standing order, award,contract of service or otherwise.\nSection 43B is not applicabie in case of employees\u2019 contribution to Provident Fundand other welfare funds. However, the employees\u2019 contribution deducted by theemployer is first treated as income under section 2(24)(x) and if the contribution isdeposited within the due date under the respective Acts, the assessee will be alloweddeduction for the same. If the employee's contribution is deposited late, deductionshall never be allowed.\nFurther, if the employees\u2019 contribution for the month of March (say for March 2020)\nis deposited within due date in the month of April, 2020 the deduction for the samewill be allowed in previous year 2019-20 itself. If the contribution for the month ofMarch (say March, 2020)is deposited after the due datein April, 2020 theemployees\u2019 contribution of the month of March, not so deposited with in due datespecified, shall be income taxable as per section 2(24)(x) and deduction of amountdeposited shall never be allowed.\nEmployee's contribution received by the employer from its employees if not paid orcredited to account of the employee's on or before the due date specified in theexplanation to section 36(1)(va), shall not be allowed as deduction even if paidbefore due date of filing return of income [Dy. CIT v Ashika Stock Broking Ltd.(2011) 56 DTR 417 (Kol) (Trib)].\nHowever, in respect of the above, Delhi High Court has held that if the employee'scontribution is not deposited by the due date prescribed under the relevant Acts and\nis deposited late, the employer not only pays interest on delayed payment but canincur penalties also, for which specific provisions are made in the Provident FundAct as well as the ESI Act. Therefore, the Acts permit the employer to make the \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019583 \ndeposit with some delays, subject to the aforesaid consequences. Insofar as the ITAct is concerned, the assessee can get the benefit if the actual payment is madebefore the return is filed. Sum deducted, by employer as employee's contribution toPF & ESI shall be eligible as deduction even if the payment is deposited after duedate mentioned under relevant Acts but before the due date of filing the return [C/T vAimil Ltd (2010) 35 DTR 68 (Del)].\nFurther, Utrakhand High Court in case of C/T v Kicha Sugar Company Lid. held thatthe due date referred to in section 36(1){va) must be read in conjuction with section43B(5) to mean the due date of filing the return of income. Similar view has beentaken in the case of CIT v NIPSO Poly Fabrics Ltd (2013) 350 ITR 327 (HP).

(Graceperiod of 5 days in case of provident fund is not allowed w.ef. 5.6.2016)\nA combined reading of Section 36(1)(va) and Section 43B of the Income Tax Actmakes it clear that if the assessee (employer) credited any sum received by him fromany of his employees on or before the due date, i.e., the date by which the assessee(employer)is requiredto credit the employees' contributionto the employees'account in the relevant fund (including the Provident Fund), he will then only beentitled to deduct the said amount in computing his business income. [C/T v Southindia Corporation Ltd, (2015) 58 taxmann.com 208 (Ker)].\nAssessee is entitled to deduction in respect of employees' contribution to ESI andEPF as provided under section 36(1)(va) only if same is paid within due date asspecified under relevant statutes. [Popular Vehicles & Services (P.) Ltd.v CIT(2018) 406 ITR 150 (Ker)]\nDue date of deposit of P.F. as per the Provident and Miscellaneous Provision Act,1952 is 15 days from the end of the month in which deduction is made. However,five days grace period is allowed for deposit of the same which shail, therefore, be20 days from the end of the month instead of 15 days.\nDue date of deposit of E.S.I. as per Employees State Insurance Act is 21 days fromthe end of month in which deduction is made. No grace period is provided in this\ncase.\nA payment within the grace period allowed by the relevant legisiation has been helddeductible asit should be treated as payment in time [CIT v Modi Spinning & \n584A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nWeaving Mills Co. Lid (2007) 292 ITR 479 (Del)]. (Grace period of 5 days in case ofprovident fund is not allowed w.ef. 5.6.2016)Payments made to provident fund and ESI within grace period under relevantstatutory acts cannot be disallowed under section 43B [C/T v Usha Undia) Ltd(2009) 184 Taxman 83 (Del); CIT v Lakhani Rubber Udyog Lid (2009) 184 Taxman236 (P&H)].

Lid. (2013) 216 Taxman 327 (SC): (2013) 263 CTR257 (SC)].\nWhere the assessee had applied in the year 1981 for approval for the group gratuityscheme and the approval was pending with Commissioner for almost 25 years, it washeld that once an application had been moved for approval and had not been rejected,the claim on the sum of contribution could not have been disallowed merely because\nthe Commissioner had not accorded approval. [PCIT v Rajasthan State SeedCorporation Lid. (2016) 386 ITR 267 (Raj)]\nWhere assessee had filed application to competent authority for approving gratuityscheme and it had duly complied with conditions laid down for approval undersection 36(1)(v), Assessing Officer ought not to have disallowed assessee's claim fordeduction under section 36(I)(v) merely because Commissioner had not grantedapprovaltoGratuity Scheme.[C7Tv Jaipur Thar Gramin Bank (2017)81taxmann.com 126 (Raj): (2016) 388 ITR 228 (Raj)]\nWhere, assesse-company had created a fund for providing gratuity to its employees,though there was delay in granting approval by Commissioner, however, conditionsof approval as seen from clause (3) of Part-C of Schedule IV had been satisfied, itsclaim for deduction would be allowable.

The liability would generally accrue year after year.However, due to practical difficulties in computing the deduction allowable on \n586A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \naccrual basis, it has been provided under section 40A(7) that deduction on account ofprovision for gratuity shall be allowed only when:\n(2)the amount of gratuity has been paid or actually become payable during theprevious year to the employees\u2019 (provided deduction has not been claimedunder clause (6) below); or\n(4)when a provision has been made for payment of a sum by way of anycontribution towards an approved gratuity fund.\nTherefore, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any provision made for thepayment of gratuity to the employees, even though the assessee may be following themercantile system of accounting, unless it is a provision for the purpose of paymentof a sum by way of any contribution towards an approved gratuity fund. \n1.Where any provision made by the assessee for payment of gratuity to theemployees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for anyreason has been allowed asa deduction in computing the income of anassessee for any assessment year, any\nsum paid out of such provision by way of contribution towards an approvedgratuity fund or by way of gratuity to any employee shall not be allowed as adeduction in computing the income of the assessee of the previous year inwhich sum is so paid.\n 2.Although provision for gratuity to the approved gratuity fund is allowed asdeduction, but it will be subject to provisions of section 43B. Normally, a deduction which is allowable under section 30 to 36 is not allowableunder section 37. However, the provisions of section 36(1)(v) have to be read withsection 40A(7). Section 40A(7) makesit clear that the provisions of the sectionwould haveeffect notwithstanding anything containedin sections30to37.Therefore, although provisions relating to gratuity are concerned under section 36(1),but still a deduction of gratuity can be claimed under section 37 provided the gratuity\nGratuity payments made voluntarily not deductible: Gratuity, voluntarily paid is notdeductible, where it has not been shown that similar payments have been made to \nis a liability in praesenti capable of ascertainment and not a contingent liability ie ithas been payable during the previous year [CIT v Eastern Spinning Mills Ltd (1980)126 ITR 686 (Cal)].\nIf a deduction was not available under section 36(1)(v), a claim under section 37(1)could be made if it satisfies the conditions laid down under section 37(1) [C/T vAndhra Prabha P.

Assessee contended that this transactiontook place in normal course of money lending which was one of objects of assessee-company as per articles of Memorandum of association. Assessing Officer rejectedclaim of assessee on ground that assessee was not engaged in business of banking or|money lending. It was held that it is possible to do occasional money lending incommercial world without having such object clause also and object clause cannot beonly basis to prove money lending and it is possible for one company to lend money\nto another company for various reasons, even in absence of such object clause. Whatactually forms basis to allow benefit of claim as bad debts would be whether aparticular transaction has taken place in ordinary course of business with an intention\nto lend money. Hence, the matter was remanded back for fresh consideration.[Peninsular Plantations Ltd.v Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax (2014) 45taxmann.com 118 (Kerala)].",

According to the Dictionary for Accountants by Eric L. Kohler, 5thEdition, the expression write off means to transfer the balance of an accountpreviously regarded as an asset to an expense account or to profit and loss account.\nAll that the definition of Kohler shows, is that an account which was previouslyshown as an asset must be transferred to an expense account or the profit and lossaccount. It is not essential that the debtor\u2019s individual account should be squared offby an appropriate credit entry. Even if the credit is made in a bad debt reserveaccount against debit to the profit and loss account indicating that the entry refers toamounts due by the particular debtoror debtors,the writing offis complete[Vithaldas H. Dhanjibhai Bardanwala v CIT (1981) 130 ITR 95 (Guj)]. Similarly,where the assessee had debited a debt as irrecoverable in his profit and loss accountcrediting it, not in the debtor\u2019s personal ledger account but to a new doubtful debtsand suspense account, it was held that the writing off was not defective [CIZ/EPT vJwala Prasad Tewari (1953) 24 ITR 537 (Bom).

[StockpointShare Services (P.) Ltd. v ACIT (2017) 86 taxmann.com 206 (Ker)}\nWhere assessee had written off bad debt in its books of account and simultaneouslyreduced corresponding amount from loans and advances to debtors, it was held thatassessee would be entitled to deduction under section 36(1)(vii); it was not necessaryfor assessee to close individual account of each of its debtors in its books.

However, the assessee could not be permitted to write off the debt fong afterfinalisation of accounts and claim deduction thereof in reassessment proceedings[CIT v Hotel Ambassador (2002) 253 ITR 430 (Ker)).\nWhere accounts of assessee were open and subject to correction by auditors, baddebts could be written off even after closure of accounting period, as there is neitherany condition nor any provision under section 36(1)(vii}, that writing off of bad debtshould be done in relevant previous year, i.e., before end of financial year.

However, by virtue of the Proviso to section 36(1)(vif}), the deduction intespect of rural debts is limited to the extent of difference between the debt or partthereof written off in the previous year and the credit balance in the provision for badand doubtful debis account made under section 36(1)(viia). The proviso prevents \n600A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nbenefit of double deduction with reference to rural loans. This is in consonance with\nthe CBDT's interpretation in the Circulars.\nIn other words, for the purpose of rural loan only the position as under:\nNo deduction shall be allowed under section 36(1)(vii) to such institution as bad debt\nif the actual bad debt during the year is equal to or less than the provision for bad anddoubtful debts. However, if the actual bad debt of such institutions in the relevantprevious year is more than the provision of bad and doubtful debt, the balance shallbe allowed as deduction as bad debt under section 36(1}(vii).\nAmendment made by the Finance Act, 2013, w.e.f.

The HighCourt held that, as the payments made by the assessee to the Stock Exchange forviolation of their regulation was not an account of an offence or which is prohibitedby law, the invocation of the Explanation to section 37 of the Act was not justified(CiTvTheStockand BondTradingCompany(Bom)(HighCourt)www. itatonline.org].\nAssessee,a stock broker, claimed deduction \u2018under section 37(1} on account ofpayment of consent fee to SEBJ.

Section 37(1) is the residuary section so far as businessexpenditure is concerned. If any expenditure is not referable to any of the sections 30\nto 36 and fulfils the conditions of this section, it may be claimed hereunder. Thus, ifany particular expenditure falls within the ambit of any of the sections 30 to 36 and it\nis found not to be fulfilling the conditions for allowances laid down in that section, itcannot be claimed under the residuary section [Laxman Sejram v CIT (1964) 54 ITR763 (Guj)j.\nHowever the object of section 37(1) of the Act is not to preclude consideration of aclaim which would not fall under sections 30 to 36 of the Act. The mere fact that aclaim will not fall within sections 30 to 36 will not automatically make the claimunsustainable under section 37(1) as well.\nThe mere fact that a particular subject of deduction is expressly dealt with in one ofsections covered by sections 30 to 36 does not imply that deduction in respect of thatsubject cannot be allowed on general principles or under the residuary section ~unless the specific section is so worded as to prohibit expressly or implicitly anyallowance apart from that section and except on the conditions prescribed by thatsection.\nExpenditure of the nature mentioned in sections 30 to 36 bui actually not comingwithin their purview cannot get the benefit of section 37. Thus, provision made by\nthe assessee for actuarial liability for pension towards an unapproved scheme ofsuperannuation fund coming under sections 36(1){iv) and/or section 36(1)(\u00a5) but notcomplying with the provisions of section 40A(9) was not entitled to deduction{Brooke Bond India Lid. v Jt. CIT (2011) 55 DTR 370 (Cai)].\nAn expenditure that is not deductible under sections 30 to 36 can siill be allowed as\na deduction under the residuary section 37: Expenditure on replacement of oldmachines is in the nature of accumulated repairs and not current repairs. Therefore,\nthe High Court allowed such deduction under section 37 in place of section 31 [C/T vGitanjali Mills Lid (2004) 265 ITR 681 (Mad)].\nExpenses incurred on issue of debentures should ordinarily be allowed, if not undersection 36(1)(iii) at least under section.37 [CIT v Office of the Official Liquidator(2009) 316 ITR 181(Guj). Also see CIT v Southern Petrochemical IndustriesCorporation Ltd (2009) 311 ITR 202 (Mad)].\nThe residuary nature of the provision in section 37(1) will have to be given its fullplay. A legitimate claim in accordance with the principles of accountancy andaccording to well-established commercial practice and which must be taken intoaccount in ascertaining the true profits and gains of business cannot be stultifiedunless some statutory provision in clear words or by necessary implication negatives \n610A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\nthe adoption of such principle and practice [C/T v High Land Produce Co. Ltd(1976) 102 ITR 803 (Ker) affirmed by the Supreme Court in (1986) 158 ITR 419].\nFurther, as per sections 30 and 31 only current repairs will be allowed as deduction(except in the case of tenant of a premises) but it cannot be said that even though therepairs carried out area revenue nature, expenditure incurred thereon would beinadmissible as deduction unless repairs executed are current repairs. Amount spent\n_on accumulated repairs, if it is om revenue account would be allowable under section\n37(4) if such expenditure, in its true character is business expenditure even though itmay have been originally claimed under section 31 [J7AT v Hill & Co.

        "content": "6.314Whatarethegeneralprinciplesfordetermining whetheraparticularexpenditure is capital or revenue expenditure?\nAns,One of the most vexed questions in the computation of business income is whether aparticular expenditure is revenue expenditure or capital expenditure. For purposes ofthe income-tax, the question is important in as much as it determines whether or not\na particular expenditure is allowable as a permissible deduction. If it is revenueexpenditure,it is permissible as a deduction;if, on the other hand,it is capitalexpenditure, it is no so allowable.\nThe line of demarcation has been found to be very thin and each case has to bedecided on the facts and circumstances of the case. In any event in order to determinewhether expenditure is revenue or capital expenditure, certain broad principles have\nto be borne in mind. These principles have been formulated over a period of manydecades and have the support of a whole wealth of case law. The trend of the judicialdecisions also indicates a progressive liberalisation of the concepts and tendency willbe noticed to treat many items as revenue expenditure in regard to which, a few yearsback, a contrary conclusion would have unhesitatingly been reached.\nIn CIT v Madras Auto Service (P) Ltd (1998) 233 ITR 468 (SC), the apex courtsummarized the general principles applicable in determining whether a particularexpenditure is capital or revenue expenditure as follows:\n(1)Outlay is deemed to be capital when it is made for the initiation of a business, forextension of a business, or for a substantial replacement of equipment.\n(2)Expenditure may be treated as property attributable to capital when it is made notonly once and for all, but with a view to brining into existence an asset or anadvantage for the enduring benefit of a trade. If what is got rid of by a lump sumpayment is an annual business expense chargeable against revenue, the lumpsum payment should equally be regarded as a business expense, but if the lumpsum payment brings in a capital asset, then that puts the business on anotherfooting altogether.\n(3) Whether for the purpose of the expenditure, any capital was withdrawn, or, inother words, whether the object of incurring the expenditure was to employ whatwas taken in as capital of the business. Again, it is to be seen whether the \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019611 \nexpenditure incurred was part of the fixed capital of the business or part of itscirculating capital.\n(4)Quantum of expenditure is irrelevant for deciding whether itis revenue orcapital: It is not the size of the expenditure, but its nature, which determines thecharacter of such expenditure. Capital expenditure can be small, while revenueexpenditure can be large. In the case of a hotel, the entire expenditure incurred instrengtheningthefacilitiesavailablefor accommodatinganinternationalconferenceof foreignministersby purchaseof banquettables,carpets,mattresses, furniture, lamp shades, partition panels, decorative lamps, ete wasfound admissible, since nopart of the same could be treatedas capitalexpenditure [C27 v Lake Palace Hotels and Motels P.

When are the expenses said\nto be of a personal nature?\nAns.Section37(1)expresslyforbidsdeductionof any expenditure whichcan becharacterisedas personal. Therefore, personal expenses of an assessee are notallowable as business expenditure in the computation of the profits and gains of anybusiness or profession carried on by him.\nIn State of Madras v Coelho (G.J.) (1964) 53 ITR 186 (SC), the Supreme Courtexplained that personal expenses would include expenses on the person of theassessee or to satisfy his personal needs such as clothes, food, etc., for purposes notrelated to the business for which the deduction is claimed. It was further explained\nthat every expense to discharge a personal obligation cannot become a personalexpense. For instance, it was held that payment of interest, on the facts, even though\nit was in discharge of a personal obligation, was not a personal expense and was,therefore, held to be a permissible deduction.\nInterest paid on a borrowing to enable an assessee to make a gift to meet a personalobligation cannot be deducted [Madhav Prasad Jatiav CIT (1979) 118 ITR 200\n{SC)].\nDue to exercise of his business or profession in very uncomfortable conditions, anassessee may fall ill and unless he gets well, he cannot carry on his business orprofession. But, even so, the medical expenses incurred by him are for his personaladvantage and benefit [Norman v Golder (1945) 13 ITR Supp 21 (CA)].\nAny expenditure incurred by an assessee in maintaining himself, or his family orestablishment or any sum expended by him for his boarding or lodging or clothing,\nor his clubor hotel expenses,or rents for residence or for establishment,orsecretarial charges would not be deductible.

However, wherethe person deputed for education purposes happens to be a related person the reasonfor incurring the expenditure becomes a matter of doubt as to whether it is bona fideincurred for purpose of business. In such matters,it could only be a matter ofinference from the relevant facts as to the nature and course of study, its usefulness\nfor the business and other relevant factors. Courts have taken different views on thesubject not on account of any difference in principle, but with respect to the facts ofthe case.\nIn case of C7? vy Kohinoor Paper Products (1997) 226 ITR 220 (MP) the cost ofeducation of a partner was allowed as deduction, while a similar payment was found\nto be of personal nature in CIT v Hindustan Hoisery Industries (1994) 209 ITR 383(Bom).\nFurther, the Madras High Court in M@. Subramaniam Bros. v CIT (2001) 250 ITR 769(Mad) while, dealing with a claim relating to expenditure incurred by a firm oneducation of one of the children of a partner on condition that he would join the firm\nas a partner on return on completion of the study, held such expenditure were ofpersonal nature.\nExpenditure incurred for higher studiesin USA of one of the partners of theassessee-firm was held not in the nature of capital expenditure or for personalexpenses. It was expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business of theassessee as the same were for obtaining better education and greater experience by\nthe partner [C77 v Kohinoor Paper Products (1997) 226 ITR 220 (MP)].\nExpenditure on education of the son of a director should ordinarily be of a personalnature. The fact that such education may be useful to the company, if he joins thecompany on completion by itself would not justify the deduction of such expenditure\nin the absence of any agreement obliging him to join the company after completionof education [CIT v R.K.K.R Steels P. Lid (2002) 258 ITR 306 (Mad)].\nExpenditure incurred by a company on higher studies of the director\u2019s son abroadcannot be claimed as business expenditure under section 37 on the contention that he \nIncome under the Head'Profits.and Gains of Business or Prafession\u2019641 \nwas appointed as a trainee in the company under \u201capprentice training scheme\u201d,where there was no proof of existence of such scheme [Echjay Forgings Lid. v ACIT(2010) 328 ITR 286 (Bom)].\nExpenditure incurred on the education of an employee who is also the son of adirector cannot be disallowed on the sole premise that employee who was sent forhigher education was son of one of the directors of the company. On facts, since the\n-said employee has worked for the company and has undertaken a bond to work forthe company after completing his higher education, and the said education has beenobtained by the employee whichis in relation to the business of the company,expenditure claimed by the company on said education of the employee cannot bedisallowed.[Kostub Investment Lid.v Commissioner of Income-tax (2014)45taxmann.com 123 (Del)).\nWhere there was no direct nexus between education expenses incurred abroad byassessee for director's son and business of assessee's company, such expenses couldnot be allowed as business expenditure.

The expression wholly andexclusively in section 37(1) does not mean necessarily.

The only general principle that can be derived is that under the terms of\nan agreement, if the assessee acquires a benefit of enduring nature that will constituteacquisition of an asset, any amount paid for the same wil! constitute capitalexpenditure. On the other hand,if the assessee has acquired merely technicalknowledge for the manufacture of any particular item for a specified duration, the\n_ expenditure is of revenue nature [Jonas Woodhead & Sons (Undia) Ltd v CIT (1979)\n117 ITR 55 (Mad)(FB)].\nExpenditure for acquisition of technical know-how could be either capital or revenueexpenditure depending upon the purpose for which the technical know-how wasacquired. If it is for a running business, there will be no difficultyin getting itallowed as revenue deduction [Scientific Engineering House Pvt. Lid v CIT (1986)157 ITR 86 (SC)]. Where, what is paidis only for the use of assets, it wouldordinarily be chargeable as revenue expenditure [C/T v .4.E.C. (Pumps) Lid (1998)232 ITR 316 (SC)]. But where it is completely new technology for manufacture of\u201dnew product, it may well be treated as capital expenditure (CIT v W.S. Insulators ofIndia Lid (2000) 243 ITR 348 (Mad)]. The fact that the know-how was for thepurpose of a new product need not always mean that it is a capital expenditure, if it isone of many products manufactured by the assessee, Since technology in moderncontext has a high rate of obsolescence, it often qualifies for treatment as having arevenue character rather than capital one.\nIn Eimco K.C.P. Lid v CIT (2000) 242 ITR 659 (SC), where technical know-how wasacquired by a newly floated company by allotting shares to the foreign company, theSupreme Court observed that the effect of the transaction was to reimburse thecontribution by the foreign company by way of know-how which could never betreated as expenditure, much less an expenditure laid out wholly & exclusively forpurpose of the business. \n \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019647 ",

One need not go into the question whether this additionalliability equivalent to the discount, which is incurred in praesenti but is payable infuture, represents deferred interest or not. That may depend upon the totality ofcircumstances relating to the issue of debentures, including its terms.

After repairthe thing to which the repair was carried and continues to be available for use.Replacement is different from repair. Replacement implies the removal or discarding\nof the thing that was in use, by a different or new thing capable of performing thesame function with the same or greater efficiency. The replacement of a section in aseries of machines which are inter-connected, in a segment of the production processwhich together form an integrated whole may in some circumstances, be regarded asamounting to repair. That logic cannot be extended to the entire manufacturingfacility from the stage of raw material to the delivery of the final finished product. Inorder to constitute \u2018current repairs\u2019 the expenditure must have been incurred to\u2018preserve and maintain\u2019 an already existing asset, and the object of the expendituremust not be to bring a new asset into existence or for obtaining a new advantage. It isdifficult to accept that for the purpose of determining the allowability of expenditureunder the head\u2018Repairs\u2019theentire productive apparatus ofa manufacturingcompany be treated as one single asset and wholesale replacement of completeidentifiable and distinct parts be regarded as a \u2018repair\u2019 effected to the productionfacility as a whole. While judging a claim for deduction under the Income-tax Actthe scope of the term \u2018repair\u2019 cannot be stretched beyond all recognition [Cir vMadras Cements Ltd (2002) 255 ITR 243 (Mad)].\nExpenses on repairs, renovating or remodelling of business premises.

If a sum is paid by an assessee conducting hisbusiness, because in conducting it he has acted in 2 manner which has rendered himliable to penalty, it cannot be claimed as a deductible expense. Infraction of the law\nis not a normal incident of business and, therefore, no expense which is paid by wayof penalty for a breach of the law can be said to be an amount wholly and exclusivelylaid for the purpose of the business [Haji Aziz & Abdul Shakoor Bros. v CIT (1961)41 ITR 350 (SC)}.\nBut where the assessee is not in any way at fault and still the penalty had to be paidfor the preservation of title to the goods, etc., it can be regarded as expended whollyand exclusively for the purposes of the business. For example, where the assesseehad bona fide purchased shipping documents in respect of incoming consignmentsandit waslater found that the imports were unauthorised and liabletobeconfiscated, and had to be cleared on payment of a penalty, the amount paid was held\nto be allowable [C/T v Pannalal Narottamdas & Co.

It may be noted that in the Memorandum ofFinance (No. 2) Bill, 1998 it was mentioned that the proposed amendment will result\nin disallowance of the claim made by certain tax payers of payments on account ofprotection money, extortion, haffta bribes, etc as business expenditure. \nIncome under the Head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019659 \nNomenclature of penalty does not determine whether it is penal or compensatory:Whenever any statutory impost is paid by assessee by way of damages or penalty orinterest, notwithstanding nomenclature of impost as given by statues, one has to find\nout as to whether it is compensatory or penal in nature.

CIT (2012) 20 taxmann.com244 (Visakhapatnam) it was held by Special Bench of ITAT, Vishakhapatnam, that\nthe provisions of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act would apply only to the amount whichremained payable at the end of the relevant financial year and could not be invoked\nto disallow the amount which had actually been paid during the previous yearwithout deduction of tax at source. The order of the Special Bench has since been putunder interim suspension by the Andhra Pradesh High Court.\nThe Hon'ble Calcutta High Court and Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case ofCommissioner of Income-tax, Kolkata-XT v Crescent Exports Syndicate (2013) 33taxmann.com 250 (Calcutta) and Commissioner of Income-tax-IV v. Sikandarkhan NTunvar (2013) 33 taxmann.com 133 (Gujarat) respectively, have held that section \n676A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \nA40(a)(ia) of the Act would cover not only the amounts which are payable at the endof the previous year but also which are payable at any time during the year.\nThe Hon'ble High Courts have further held that the intention of the legislation was to\n\u2019 disallow certain types of expense, subject to provisions of Chapter XVII-B which atpayable at any time during the year but no tax was deducted at source or if deductedwas not paid within the stipulated time. There is no such condition that amountshould remain payable at the end of the year.\nThe Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in CIT v Vector Shipping Service (P.) Ltd. (2013)38 taxmann.com 77 (Allahabad) has affirmed the decision of the Special Bench\nin Merilyn Shipping that for disallowance under section 40(a){ia) of the Act, theamount should be payable and not which'has been paid during the year. However,the decisions of the Hon\u2019ble*Gujarat and Calcutta High Courts (supra) were notbrought to the attention of the Hon'ble Aliahabad High Court.\nIn the case of ACIT, Circle 4(2), Mumbai v Rishti Stock and Shares Pvt.

The ITAT accordingly applied the view taken by the Hon'ble Gujarat andCalcutta High Court as ratio decidendi prevails over an orbiter dicta.\nAfter careful examination of the issue, the Board is of the considered view that theprovision of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act would cover not only the amounts which arepayable as on 31st March of a previous year but also amounts which are payable atany time during the year. The statutory provisions are amply clear and in the contextof section 40(a)(ia) of the Act the term \"payable\" would include \"amounts which arepaid during the previous year\".\nWhere any High Court decides an issue contrary to the Departmental View\u2019, the\u2018Departmental View' thereon shall not be operativein the area fallingin thejurisdiction of the relevant High Court. However, the CCIT concerned shouldimmediately bring the judgment to the notice of the CTC. The CTC shall examinethe said judgment on priority to decide as to whether filing of SLP to the SupremeCourt will be adequate response for the time being or some legislative amendment iscalled for.\nPayments made by assessee without deduction of TDS would be disallowed undersection 40(a)(ia) even if no payment remained payable on last day of financial year.\n[CIT v T.

Further, in order to invoke section 40A(2), there must be a paymentwhich is an \u2018expenditure\u2019. When an assessee sells his goods, bona fide, to a person at\na price lower than the market price, it does not constitute an \u2018expenditure\u2019. This view\nis also upheld by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in C/T v Udhoji Shrikishnadas(1983) 139 ITR 827 (MP}\n\nIn view of the above, the Assessing Officer is not justified in disallowing the rebate.\nThe assessee had supplied to its sister concerns at a lower rate compared to what wascharged to others. The Assessing Officer made an addition of 15% on the basis ofsales to others. Court held that no addition can be made merely because lower rateswere charged to sister concerns. Further sister concerns were paying tax at a higherrate than the assessee. It was held that section 40A(2) would apply to expenditureand not on sales.

This was amended by the legislature to be replaced by the expression\u201can account payee cheque or account payee bank draft\". This was donein thebackground of the experience that even crossed cheques were being endorsed infavour of a person other than the drawee making it difficult to trace the constituent ofthe money. To plug this possible loophole the requirement of section 40A(3) wasmade more stringent.
