Territorial waters would also include the seabed andsubsoil underlying such waters and the airspace over such waters. Furthermore, thelimit of the waters is with reference to the mainland of India as well as the individual\\nor composite group or groups of islands constituting part of the territory of India.\\nThe term baseline is not defined in the Act. However, Article 5 of the Convention ofthe Law of the Sea, 1982 refers to the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of\\n. the territorial sea as the low water line along the coast as marked on the large-scale\\ncharts officially recognised by the coastal States.\\nIn the absence of a measurement: mechanism being provided under the Territorial\\nAct, the distance of 12 nautical! miles from the baseline should be considered ordetermined in accordance with the customary international law.\\nSection 6(1) provides that the continental shelf:\\n‘comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond the limitof its territorial waters throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to theouter edge of the continental margin or to a distance of two hundred nautical milesfrom the baseline referred to in sub-section (2) of section 3 where the outer edge ofthe continental margin does not extend up to that distance’.\\nThe continental shelf would extend to the outer edge of the continental margin or to adistance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline.\\nArticle 76(3) of the Convention of the Law of the Sea, 1982 provides that thecontinental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the land mass of thecoastal State, sea-bed and sub-soil of the shelf, siope and rise. It does not include thedeep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges and the subsoil thereof. The \"slope\" would\\n \\n1A nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kms. \\nIntroduction3 \\nrefer to the steep slope with which the shelf terminates and the \"rise\" refers to theless sharply sloping area between the slope and the seabed.\\nSection 7(1) of the Territorial Act defines the exclusive economic zone as:\\n\"an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial waters, and the limit of such zone\\nis two hundred nautical miles from the baseline”.\\nHowever, section 9 of the Territorial Act provides that notwithstanding anythingcontained in the Territorial Act, where the maritime boundaries between India andother states, having coasts opposite or adjacent to those of India in regard to theirrespectiveterritorialwaters,contiguouszones,continentalshelves,exclusiveeconomic zone and other maritime zones, shalf be as determined by an agreementbetween India and such state, and pending agreement between India and any such\\nstate. Unless any other provisional arrangements are agreed between them, themaritime boundaries between India and another state shall not extend beyond the\\nline, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest point from which thebreadth of the territorial waters of India and another state is measured.\\nThough the definitions of the various maritime zones are mutually exclusive, for thepurpose of the Act they would now practically be considered to apply to an area ofup to 200 nautical miles from the appropriate baseline.\\nAirspace would cover the area over the territory and the territorial waters thatexténds up fo airspace above12 nautical miles from the nearest point of theappropriate baseline. However, airspace would not extendto space above thecontiguous zones, continental shelves, exclusive economic zone and other maritimezones as defined under the Territorial Act.\\nAirspace has not been defined and, hence, its meaning would have to be considered\\nin accordance with international principlesor customary international laws. Anumber of schools of thought on what could constitute an airspace describe airspace\\nas being equivalent to atmospheric space, any space where air is found, or where the‘area where an artificial satellite may be put in orbit or an area after which outer spacewould be considered. At the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,Forty-ninth Session, Vienna, 7-16 June 2006, the members considered that the lackof a definitionor delimitation of outer space brought about legal uncertaintyconcerning the applicability of space law and air law and those matters concerningstate sovereignty and the boundary between airspace and outer space needed to beclarified in order to reduce the possibility of disputes among states. However, theCommittee remained inconclusive on account of the fact that the current framework\\non outer space was functioning well and there would not be a need to address thisconcern until such time as there was a demonstrated need and a practical basis fordeveloping a definition or delimitation of outer space. Any attempt to define ordelimit outer space would be a theoretical exercise, could lead to- complicatingexisting activities and might not be ableto anticipate continuing technologicaldevelopments.\\nIt may seem that the perimeter which would limit the airspace of an orbiting satellitemay be considered as the most likely boundary to be accepted. However, in the \\nA Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\\nabsence of a clear definition, thereis likely to be litigationin respect of whatconstitutes airspace.',\n",

One\\nof the most important components of the Budget is the Finance Bill, which declaresthe financial proposals of the Central Government for the next financial year. The\\nBill contains various amendments which are sought to be made in the areas of directand indirect taxes levied by the Central Government. The Finance Bill also mentionsthe rates of income tax and other taxes which are given in various Schedules attached\\nto such Finance Bill. The First Schedule read with section 2 of the Finance Bill givesthe rates of income tax in three parts:\\nPart-I: _ It gives the normal rates of income tax for various assessees for the currentassessment year e.g. the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 had given the rates ofincome tax for the assessment year 2019-20 and the Finance Act, 2020 hasgiven the rates of income tax for the assessment year 2020-21.\\nPart-II:It gives the rates for deduction of tax at source from the income earned in\\nthe current financial year e.g. the Finance Act, 2020 has given the rates atwhich taxisto be deductedat source in the financial year 2020-21,Similarly, the Finance Act, 2021 shall give the rates of TDS on the incomeearned during the financial year 2021-22.\\nRates.under Part II are given for tax to be deducted under sections 193,194A, 1948, 194BB, 194D 194LBA, 194LBB, 194LBC and 195 of theIncome Tax Act,\\nRates of TDS for other sections are given in Chapter XVIIB of the IncomeTax Act itself. Further rates for collection at source (TCS) are given insection 206C of Chapter XVIIBB of the Income Tax Act only.\\nPart-II:It gives the normal rates for calculating income tax for deducting tax fromincome chargeable under the head ‘Salaries’. The same rates are applicablefor computation of advance tax to be paid in the current financial year forincomes taxable at normal rates, e.g., Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 had given\\nthe rates for the computation of advance tax for the financial year 2019-20 (i.e, assessment year 2020-21) and the Finance ‘Act, 2020 has given therates of advance tax for financial year 2020-21(. e. assessment year2021-22). \\nIntroduction5 \\nFor certain incomes, advance tax has to be computed at special ratesprescribed in the various sections of the Income Tax Act.\\nFurther, the same normal rates of income tax are applicable in a casewhere income tax has to be charged under sections 172(4), 174(2), 174A,175 or 176(2) in the same previous year in which such income is earned.\\nPart-IV:In additions to the above Parts, Part IV of Schedule I gives the rules forcomputation of Net Agricultural Income.\\n 1.When the Finance Billis approved by both the Houses ofParliament and receives the assent of the President, it becomes\\nthe Finance Act. The provisionsof such Finance Actarethereafter incorporated in the Income-tax Act.\\n2.Part-I] of Schedule I of a particular Finance Act, which givesthe rates for computation of Advance Tax and TDS on salary,\\netc, generally becomes Part-1 of the subsequent Finance Act,\\ne.g., Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, Part-II, had given the rates forcomputation of advance tax for the financial year 2019-20 (i.e.assessment year 2020-21). The same rates have become the rates\\n \\nof income tax for the assessment year 2020-21 in the FinanceAct, 2020. Similarly, rates given under Part III of Schedule I of\\nthe Finance Act, 2020 will become Part I of Schedule I of theFinance Act, 2021 and these will be the rates of income tax forassessment year 2021-22.\",\n",

Kadambande (1992) 195 ITR 877 heldthat voluntary payment received by an assessee does not have the character ofincome as the assessee has no right to enforce the payment, the payment can bestopped at any time at the will of the grantor.

In the present case, since the business itselfhad been discontinued due to war conditions, the amount of compensation received\\nis a capital receipt and, therefore, not taxable. Stock-in-trade loses the character ofstock-in-trade if it had been frozen and not available for sale for a long time becauseof enemy action. Hence, the assessee’s claim is correct.

       "  'content': '1.43What is the treatment of tainted/illegal income?\\nAns,Income is income, though tainted. For purposes of income tax, there is no differencebetween legal and tainted income. Even illegal income is taxed just like any legalincome. By taxing such income, the State is not taking part in the crime or condoning\\nit, nor would it become a principal or a sharer in the illegality. The revenue merelylooks at an accomplished fact, viz, on profits having been earned and assess thesame. The assessee may be prosecuted for the crime and yet be charged on the profit.Where the -assessee supplied penny-in-the-slot automatic machinesto licensedvictuallers and proprietors of places of public resort on a profit-sharing systembetween him and the occupier of the business, for which the assessee was liable to beprosecuted,it was held that the profits from suchactivity were neverthelessassessable. For example, the income earned from smuggling activities would also betaxable under the Act. if this were not so, then the illegal activity would be put at a\\n_ premium becausea person carrying on this activity would get immunity from\\npayment of taxes, while an honest tax-payer carrying on a legal business would bepaying taxes on his income.\\nHowever, as per Explanation to section 37(1), any expenditure incurred by anassessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law shall notbe deemed to have been incurred for the purpose of business or profession and nodeduction or allowance shal! be made in respect of such expenditure.\\nExplanation to section 37(1) is applicable only in case of expenditure pertaining to\\nillegal business and not in the case of business loss [7.4. Quereshi v CIT (2006) 157Taxman 514 (SC)].\\nThus, if there is business loss on account of illegal income, it is allowable but if anyexpenditure is incurred in earning that income it shall not be allowed as deduction inview of Explanation to section 37(1).\\nInstances of tainted income: \\nIntroduction27 \\n(a)profits from wagering contracts [C/T v Chunilal B.

       "  'content': \"1.44What is ‘application of income’ and ‘diversion of income’?\\nAns.Where an assessee has alienated or assigned a source of income so that it is no longertheirs, he/she would not be liable to be taxed upon the income arising from thesource of income so assigned, as the income is diverted by an overriding title. Forexample, if a businessman receives an extra amount from his customers specifically\\nfor charity and is obliged by a contract or custom to utilise it for charitable purposesonly, the amount is received by him as a trustee for charity and cannot be taxed as hisincome [CIT v Tollygunge Club Ltd (1977) 107 ITR 776 (SC)].\\nWhere an assessee does not alienate or assign the source of income, but merelyapplies the income so that it passes through their hands to be received by another, itwould still remain their income as it is a mere application of income received bythem. For example, where mines are leased by the proprietor to a creditor with adirection to apply the royalty income in liquidation of the debt owed, royalty incomewould be assessable as income in the hands of the lessor as it is a mere application ofincome' andnot diversionbyanoverridingtitle [C/T v Manager of KatrasEncumbered Estate (1934) 2 ITR 100 (Pat)].\\nIn other words, where an assessee applies an income to discharge an obligation after\\nthe income reaches the hands of the assessee, it would be an application of incomeand this would result in taxation of such income in the hands of the assessee.However, where there is a diversion of income before it reaches the hands of theassessee, it cannot be treated as an income of the assessee.\\nIt may be very hard,in individual cases,to drawa line between whatis anapplication of income and what is a diversion de hors the assessee.\\nThe assessee is an International player representing India and the Indian TennisAssociation open a development fund account in the name of the assessee and out ofthe remuneration payable to the assessee a part of it was retained and transferred into\\nthe development find account. To determined whether the amount transferred to thefund constitutes the income of the assessee or not it is to be seems whether thedevelopment fund is created by the assessee on his own or at the instance of theassociation pursuant to the agreement entered in to between the association and theassessee and whether the assessee is entitled to claim the development fund from theassociation as a matter of right [C77 v Mahesh Bhupathi (2010) 43 DTR 159 (Kar)]. \\n28A Compendiwun of Issues on Income Tax\",\n",

       "  'content': '1.45Whatis the difference between ‘diversion of income’ and ‘applicationofincome’?\\nAns,In order to decide whethera particular disbursement amounts to diversion orapplication of income, the true test is to probe into, and decide, whether the amountsought to be deducted, in truth, did not or did reach the assessee as his own income.Obligations are there in every case, but it is the nature of the obligation which is thedecisive factor. There is a difference between an amount which a person is obliged toapply out of his income and an amount which by the nature of the obligation cannotbe said to be part of his income of the assessee. Whereby the obligation, income isdiverted before it reaches the assessee,it is deductible; but where the income isrequired to be applied to discharge an obligation after such income reaches theassessee, the same consequence in law does not follow. It is the first kind of paymentwhich can truly be excused and not the second. The second payment is merely anobligation to pay another a portion of one’s own income which has been receivedand is since applied. The first is a case in which the income never reaches theassessee, who even if he were to collect it, does so, not as part of his income but forand on behalf of the person to whom it was payable [C/T v Sitaldas Tirathdas (1961)41 {TR 367 (SC)].\\n \\nIt is only when income or a portion of income is diverted at the source by anoverriding title before it started flowing into the channel which was to reach theassessee concerned that it could be excluded from his assessable income [C/T v L.Bansi Dhar (1968) 67 ITR 374 (Del)}.\\nDiversion or application of income: An obligation to apply the income in a particularway before it is received by the assessee or before it has accrued or arisen to theassessee results in the diversion of the income. On the other hand, an obligation toapply income which has accrued or arisen or has been received amounts merely to\\nthe apportionment of the income, and nottoits diversion [Raja Bejoy SinghDudhuria v CIT (1933) 1 ITR 135 (PC)}.\\nWhere the income accrues to the assessee directly and is merely applied, upon suchaccrual, to discharge an obligation of the assessee, it is a case of mere application ofthe income of the assessee [Vibhuti Glass Works v CIT (1989) 177 ITR 439 (SC).\\nPayment made by assessee to its retiring partners were a self-imposed obligationbeing gratuitous and hence, application of income not allowable as deduction [S. B.Billimoria & Co, y ACIT (2010) 125 ITD 122 (Mum)j.\\nIt is not every obligation to apply income in a particular way that results in diversion\\nof income before it reaches the assessee. Unless and until there is an overridingobligation, the amount received from the assessee cannot be treated as income of theperson receiving the amount [Arvind Singh v CIT (1986) 160 ITR 908 (Raj)].\\nIn case of diversion of income by overriding title, person in whose favour income is\\nto diverted should be aware about exact amount of such income which it has earned.\\nIf such fact is not proved to the: satisfaction of Assessing Officer, such income shallbe taxabie in the hands of the recipient [U.P. Bhumi Sudhar Nigam v CIT (2005) 280ITR 197 (Ail)]. \\nIntroduction29\\nIf the obligation is on the receipt of the income and not on the source of it, the legaleffect is different. In the one case, income is diverted at source and hence cannot bedeemed to have accrued or arisen therefrom.In the other case, the income hasaccrued and therefore, it has to be applied in a particular manner. In the former case,\\nthe income is not included at all. In the latter case it is.',\n",

Anypayment by him to such relations in discharge of that personal obligationwould be merely an instance of an application by the assessee of a part of hisincome [C77 v Lakshmi Narayan (1981) 132 ITR 355 (Mad)].\\n(2)The circumstance that a decree is passed by a court of law, either by consent orotherwise, for the payment of such maintenance would not take the case out ofthe category of application of income.\\n(3)Where the assessee-society received royalties and after deducting expenses andcreating reserve fund, distributed the royalties among its members, it was heldthat the royalties were the assessee’s income and it had merely applied it in aparticular way [Performing Right Society Ltd v CIT (1977) 106 ITR 11 (SC)].\\n(4)Ifa lawyer conducting the defence for an accused in a criminal trial stipulates\\nfor a fee stating that he would create a public charitable trust thereof, the saidamount when received by the lawyer cannot be said to have been divertedaway before reaching the lawyer. The expression of a desire on the part of thelawyer to create a charitable trust is not tantamount to an actual creation of the\\ntrust.

How would you contest the action of the Assessing Officer?\\nAns.According to the code of conduct and rules laid down by the Chartered AccountantsAct, 1949 and Chartered Accountants Regulations, money belonging to the clientshas to be kept in a separate bank account. The chartered accountant holds suchmoney in a fiduciary capacity. The beneficial interest in this money is that of theclient under section 94 of the Indian Trusts Act. The chartered accountant being atrustee, cannot use or deal with the money for his own benefit. The corpus being thatof the client, the interest derived from such corpus is also subject to the fiduciaryrelationship. Hence, the proposal of the Assessing Officer to assess the interestincome in the hands of the chartered accountant is incorrect. Alternately, it may beassumed that the client has got a clear title to the money and any interest arisingthereon should properly belong to him and‘not to the chartered accountant. Hence, \\nIntroduction33 \\nthe chartered accountant is not liable to pay tax on interest income on the basis ofprinciple of overriding title.',\n",

In the case of a sportsman who is a professional, the award received byhim will be in the nature of a benefit in exercise of his profession and, therefore, willbe liable to tax under the provisions of the Income-tax Act. However, in the case of anon-professional, the award received by him will be in the nature of a gift and/or \\nIntroduction35\\npersonal testimonial. In view of this, it is clarified that such awards in the cases of asportsman, who is not a professional, will not be liable to tax in his hands as it wouldnot be in the nature of income. The question whether a sportsman is a professional ornot will depend vpon the facts and circumstances of each case to be decided by theAssessing Officer [Circular No. 447, dated 22-1-1986].Hence, gifts/prizes/awards/rewards received by a non-professional sportsman wouldnot be income under section 2(24) in his hands by virture of Circular No. 447, dated22.1.1986.

What is the meaning of ‘place ofeffective management’ inserted by the Finance Act, 2016?\\nUnder the existing section 6(3), due to the requirement that whole of control andmanagement should be situated in India and that too for whole of the year, thecondition had been rendered to be practically inapplicable. A company could easilyavoid becoming a resident by simply holding a board meeting outside India. Thisfacilitated creationof shell companies which wereincorporatedoutsidebutcontrolled from India. ‘Place of effective management’ (POEM) is an internationallyrecognized. concept for determination of residence of a company incorporated in aforeign jurisdiction. Most of the tax treaties entered into by India recognise theconcept of \\'place of effective management’ for determination of residence of acompany as a tie-breaker rule for avoidance of double taxation. Many countriesprefer the POEM test to be appropriate test for determination of residence of acompany. The principle of POEM is recognized and accepted by Organisation ofEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also.

       "  'content': '2.42How does the method of accounting affect the concept of accrual and arisal ofincome and the receipt of the income?\\nAns,Income is liable to be taxed on the basis of its accruing or arising to the assessee, or\\nits receipt by the assessee, during the relevant previous year. The accrual or arisingof income is generally dependent on the method of accounting employed by theassessee. In the cash system of accounting, the accrual or arising of the income willbe simultaneous with its receipt. In the mercantile system of accounting, the accrualof income is not independent of its receipt. So long as the amount is due to theassessee, the system of accounting would envisage the amount being treated ashaving accrued to the assessee [CIT v Planters Co. (P) Lid (1980) 124 ITR 648, 650-51 (Mad)]. In the mercantile system of accounting, the profit or loss at the end of theaccounting period is based not on the difference between what was actually receivedand what was actually paid out, but on the difference between the right to receive andthe liability to pay.\\n \\nHowever, it has been especially provided that in case of income from salaries, theliability to tax arises immediately when income is due to the assessee irrespective ofthe method of accounting followed.\\nLikewise, in the case of dividends, the income would be included in total income ofthe shareholder under section 8 in the year in which final dividend is declared and in\\nthe case of interim dividend in the year in which they are made unconditionallyavailable to the shareholders.\\nWhere the assessee carrying construction activity, had contracted for retention of10% of the contract amountas retention money which was payable after thecompletion of the contract, it was held that such money accrued to the assessee onlyafter the completion of contract and final inspection and on the basis of bills. Henceno enforceable liability has accrued or arisen prior to such date. [C/T v East CoastConstruction & Industries Ltd. (2007) 160 Taxman 399 (Mad)}] However, it will nowbe treated as income as per Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS).\\nIn mercantile system of accounting, interest ‘on security deposits lying with theExcise Department should be included on accrual basis. [Kerala Highway Corpn.(1995) 51 TTY 508 (Coch) (AT)].\\nMethod of accounting not to affect the range of taxable income: The regular mode of‘accounting determines only the mode of computing the taxable income and the pointof time at which the tax liability is attracted. Where no income has resulted, it cannotbe said that income has accrued merely on the ground that the assessee had beenfollowing the mercantile system of accounting.\\nThe concept of accrual of income depends on the interests/rights of the partiesconcerned and not by the method of accounting followed by the assessee. Thus,although wherethe accountsof an assessee following mercantile methodofaccounting are prepared on accrual basis, taxability thereof is decided by the fact of \\n Scope of Total Income and Residential Status73\\naccrual and not by the method of accounting followed by the assessee. Where theincome has arisen has to be examined in the context of commercial principles[Poona Electric Supply Co. v CIT (1965) 57 ITR 521 (SC)]-\\nTaxability of income: A profit can be said to have accrued or a liability or loss can besaid to have been incurred only when the profit is either actually due or the liabilitybecomes enforceable. A mere claim to a profit or to a liability is not sufficient tomake the profit to accrue or the liability to be incurred for the purposes of theIncome-tax Act [C/T v Associated Commercial Corporation (1963) 48 ITR1(Bom)].\\nMere sending of bills for goods sold charging a rate which was never payable doesnot amount to accrual of income embedded in those bill amounts. Sending the billsamounted merely to making a claim and does not create a legal enforceable right forthe amount [C/T v Nadiad Electric Supply Co. Ltd (1971) 80 ITR 650 (Bom)].Similarly, the mere posting of an entry in the account books of the assessee wouldnot always supply conclusive evidence on the question whether the disputed amountshave accrued to the assessee or not [C/T v Western Indian Engineering Co. (1971)811 ITR 712 (Guj)).\\nIncome can be said to have accrued when a person acquires an enforceable right toreceive the amount. Thus, where an amountis received as an advance towardsincome, it cannot be said to have accrued at the time of receipt because the same isreceivedasadeposit,and income would accrueonly whenthe amountisappropriated towards the income receivable [CIT v Surendra Overseas Ltd (1982)136 ITR 553 (Cal)].\\nWhere assessee was engaged in business of providing telecom services to bothprepaid and postpaid subscribers, unutilized amount on prepaid card at end of yearwas to be treated as advance in balance-sheet and recognized as a revenue receipt insubsequent year, when talk time was actually used or was exhausted.

Under theAct, non-residents are taxable in India in respect of income that accrues or arises inIndia or is received in India or is deemed to accrue or arise in India or is deemed tobe received in India. Under the existing provisions of the Act, a gift of money orproperty is taxed in the hands of donee, except for certain exemptions provided insection 56(2)(x). It has been reported that gifts are made by persons being residents\\nin India to persons outside India and are claimed to be non-taxable in India as theincome does not accrue or arise in India. To ensure that such gifts made by residents\\nto persons outside India are subject to tax, amendments have.to be made in section 9of the Act.\\n(&) Amendment made\\nThe Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 has inserted clause (viii) to section 9(1) to providethat income arising outside India, being any sum of money referred to in sub-clause\\n({xviia) of clause (24) of section 2, paid on or after 5.7.2019 by a person resident inIndia to a non-resident, not being a company, or to a foreign company, shall bedeemed to accrue or arise in India.However, the existing provision for exempting gifts as provided in proviso to section56(2)(x) will continue to apply for such gifts deemed to accrue or arise in India.These exemptions are in respect of the sum of money or any property is received:—\\n(a)from any relative; orA\\n(5)on the occasion of the marriageof the individual; or\\n(c)under a will or by way of inheritatice; or\\n(2)incontemplation of death of the payer or donor, as the case may be; or\\n(e)from any local authority as defined in the Explanation to section 10(20); or(from any fund or foundation or university or other educational institution orhospital or other medical institution or any trust or institution referred to insection 10(23C); or\\n(g)from any trust or institution registered under section 124A; or\\n(4)by way of transaction not regarded as transfer under clause (vicb) or clause (vid)\\nor clause (vii) of section 47\\nIn a treaty situation, the relevant article of applicable DTAA shall continue to apply\\nfor such gifts as well.',\n",

       "  'content': '2.48\\nAns.The definition of the expression business given in the Income-tax Act, 1961 is aninclusive one. The expression business connection, however, is not defined in theAct. it is manifest that the words in section 9{1} and section 163 of the Act arecomprehensive enough to include all heads of Income mentioned in section 14 of theAct. It is, no doubt, true that there is specific reference to business in section 9(1) ofthe Act and there is no reference to profession. But no tenable reason is discerniblefrom the statute for excluding income arising out of profession from its scope. Theexpression business does not necessarily mean trade or manufacture only. It is beingused as including within its scope no good professions, vocations and callings fromfairly Jong time. There could be no good reason for Parliament for excluding non-resident professional men from the purview of section 9(1) of the Act. Also, there isno material on record in the instant case to reach that conclusion. The word business\\nis one of wide import andit means an activity carried on continuously andsystematically by a person by the application of his labour or skill with a view toeatinganincome.Hence,inthe contextin whichthe expressionbusinessconnectionis used in section 9(1) of the Act, there is no warrant for giving arestricted meaningtoit by excluding professional connections fromits scope[Barendra Prasad Ray v ITO (1981) 129 ITR 295 (SC)].',\n",

Aggarwal & Co (1965) 56 ITR 20 (SC). Abusiness connection invoives a relation between 2 business carried out by a non-resident which yields profits and gains and some activity in the taxable territorieswhich contributes directly or indirectly to the earning of those profits or gains. It \\nScope of Total Income and Residential Status77 \\npredicates an element of continuity between the business of the non-resident and theactivity in the taxable territories, a stray or isolated transaction is normally not to beregarded as a business connection.

In each case, the questionwhether there is a business connection from or through which income, profits orgains arise or accrue toa non-resident must be determined upon the facts andcircumstances of the case.

Further there were certain issues in respect of income deemed to accrue or arise\\nwhere there were conflicting decisions of various judicial authorities.\\nThe legislative intent of this clause was to cover incomes, which were accruing orarising directly or indirectly from a source in India. The section codifies the sourcerule of taxation, which signifies that where a corporate structure is created to routefunds, the actual gain or income arises only in consequences of the investment made\\nin the activity to which such gains are attributable and not the mode through whichsuch gains are realized. This principle which supports the source country\\'s right to\\ntax the gains derived from off shore transactions, where the value is attributable tothe underlying assets, is recognised internationally by several countries.\\nTherefore following Explanations have been inserted w.r.e.f. 1-4-1962 for providingcertainty of law:\\nExplanation 4-—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the expression“through” shall mean and include and shall be deemed to have always meant andincluded “by means of”, “in consequence of” or “by reason of”. \\nScope of Total Income and Residential Status97 \\nExplanation $.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that an asset or acapital asset being any share or interest ina company or entity registered orincorporated outside India shall be deemed to be and shall always be deemed to havebeen situated in India, if the share or interest derives, directly or indirectly, itsvalue substantially from the assets located in India.\\n“Provided that nothing contained in this Explanation shall apply to an asset or capitalasset, which is held by a non-resident by way of investment, directly or indirectly, in\\na Foreign Institutional Investor as referred to in clause (a) of the Explanation tosection 115AD for an assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April,2012 but before the 1st day of April, 2015.\" [First proviso inserted w.r.e.f. 1.4.2012]\"Provided further that nothing contained in this Explanation shall apply to an asset orcapital asset, which is held by a non-resident by way of investment, directly orindirectly,inCategory-Ior Category-IIforeignportfolioinvestorundertheSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations,2014, made under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.\" [Secondproviso inserted w.r.e.f. 1.4.2015]\\nAmendment made by the Finance Act, 2020\\nExplanation 5 modified [W.e.f.

Second proviso tosaid Explanation,inserted throughthe FinanceAct,2017, providesthattheExplanation shall not apply to an asset or capital asset, which is held by a non-resident by way of investment, directly or indirectly, in Category-I or Category-ILforeign portfolio investor under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (ForeignPortfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 [SEBI (FPI} Regulations, 2014].\\nVide Gazette Notification No. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2019/36, SEBI has notifiedSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors} Regulations,2019 {SEBI (FPI) Regulations, 2019] and repealed the SEBI (FPI) Regulations,2014. The difference between these two regulations pertinent in the present context\\nis that the SEBI has done away with the broad basing criteria for the purposes ofcategorization of portfolios and has reduced the categories from three to two. In viewof the same, necessary modification needs to be made in the proviso so inserted.\\nHence, the Finance Act, 2020 has provided that the exception from said Explanation\\n5 provided to an asset or a capital asset, held by a non-resident by way of investment\\nin erstwhile Category I and Il FPIs under the SEB] (FPI) Regulations, 2014 may begrandfathered.

The sourcerule would mean that irrespective of the situs of the services, the situs of the payerand the situs of the utilisation of services will determine the tax jurisdiction.\\nFurther, section 5, which defines scope of total income, is subject to other provisionsof the Act, which would include section 9, and the income deemed to accrue or arise\\nin terms of section 9 gets covered under section 5.

Further, it was heldthat where any sum is payable to a non-resident by a resident, the deeming sweep of\\nthe said section cannot bring to tax, any income of a non-resident received outside\\n.

In regard to fees fortechnical services, it was specifically held that for the fees to be taxable in India, theservices have not only to be utilised in a business in India, but also have to berendered in India.Legislative intent for introduction of clauses (v), (vi) and (vii) was to give legalsanctity to the source rule. This source rule is also recognised in India's DoubleTaxation Avoidance Agreements. Hence, for removai of doubts, an Explanation tosection9 was inserted w.r.e.f.1.6.1976to specifically reaffirm the source ruleprovided in that section, to clarify that:\\n‘where income is deemed to accrue or arise in India under clause {v), (vi) or (vii)\\nof section 9(1), such income shall be included in the total income of the non-resident, regardless of whether the non-resident has a residence or place ofbusiness or business connection in India.

Rule 8D prescribes the mechanism for workingout the disallowance under section 14A and the Assessing Officer is bound to adoptTule 8D for making disallowances under section 14A where he is not satisfied withthe correctness of the claim of the assessee in respect of such an expenditure. Rule8D shall be applicable to all pending matters [J7O v Daga Capital Management Pvt. \\nComputation of Total Income217 \\nLid (2009) 117 ITD 169 (Mum){SB).

As also thecash flow of the assessee was not seen. Therefore, the apportionment on a pro ratabasis was improper in the absence of anything brought by the Assessing Officer torebut the assessee’s stand that the investment in the tax free bonds had been made outof the funds of own funds (CIT v Here Cycles Ltd (2010) 323 ITR 518 (P&H) andWinsome Textile Industries 319 ITR 204 (P&H) followed) [Dy.

For one year, the firm paidinterest which was offered as income by the assessee while for the second year it didnot pay interest as it made a loss. The assessee claimed the interest paid on theborrowing as a deduction under section 36(1)(iii). The AO disallowed the claim onthe ground that as the borrowings had been invested in the firm and the income from\\nthefirm was exempt under section10(2A),theinterest expenditure was notallowable u/s 14A.It was held that there is no (tax-free) profit for the relevantassessment year [C/T v Delite Enterprises (2011) 135 TTJ 663: 50 DTR 193: 128ITD 146 (Mum.)].\\nAssessee received dividend, being exempt from income tax, from the investmentmade in the earlier years. During the year, it had interest free funds, more than theinvestment made by it.

In eachcase depending upon the attending facis and circumstances, the terms and conditionsof the engagement, a finding can be arrived at as to whether there is a master-servant\\nor an employer-employee relationship. It can be arrived at in case, where it is foundby the income-tax authorities that though there is not a regular process of recruitmentand appointment,the contract would indicate that the doctor/professional wasappointed as an employee and on a regular basis.\\nThus where doctors were drawing fixed plus variable pay with written contracts andon verifying the terms and conditions, the Tribunal concluded that neither of thedoctors was entitled to provident fund or any terminal benefits and they were free tocarry on their private practice at their own clinic in or outside hospitals but beyondthe hospital timings. It was held that all of these could be seen as indicators that theywere not employees but independent professionals. The amounts paid to them did notamount to salary. [CIT (TDS) v Grant Medical Foundation (Ruby Hall Clinic) (2015)375 ITR 49 (Borm)]\\nWhere the terms of the contract ipso facto proved that the contract between theassessee-company and the doctors was of “contract for service\" not a \"contract ofservice” as the remuneration paid to the doctors depended on the treatment of thepatients. Further, Consultancy charges were paid to the doctors towards renderingtheir professional skill and expertise which are purely in the nature of professionalcharges and the assessee-company had no control over the doctors engaged by them \\nComputation of Total Income229 \\nwith regard to treatment of patients, it was held that the non-competition clause in\\nthe agreement would not invalidate the nature of the profession. It would not alter thenature of professional service rendered by the doctors. The Tribunal also found thatnone of the doctors were entitled to gratuity, provident fund, leave travel allowance\\nor other terminal benefits. The doctors had filed their returns of income for therelevant assessment years showing the income received from the assessee-company\\nas professional income and this had been accepted by the Department.

It is however immaterial that for thispurpose the tax is paid under a contract or voluntarily by the employer according tocustom. If the employer pays without a contract, the tax paid by him would form aperquisite or an emolument of the office within the meaning of section 17(2)(iv) andwould be chargeable under this head.If, on the other hand, taxis paid under acontract of employment, the very contract would constitute remuneration at a highersalary thanis represented by the actual sum received by the employee [Datar(RBDD) v CIT (1952) 21 ITR 558 (Nag)]. However, as per section 10(10CC) tax onnon-monetary perquisites paid by the employer shall be exempt in the hands of theemployee. Having regard to section 200 of the Companies Act, 1956, an Indiancompany cannot pay any salary which is tax free or which varies with the taxpayable by the employee.

       "  'content': \"4.31What is the basis for charging income under the head salaries?\\nAns.As per section 15, the following income shall be chargeable to income-tax under thehead ‘Salaries’:\\n(a)any salary due from an employer or a former employer to an assessee in theprevious year, whether paid in that previous year or not;\\n(b)any salary paid or allowed to him in the previous year by or on behalf of anemployer or a former employer though not due in that previous year or before itbecame due to him;\\n(c)any arrears of salary paid or allowed to him in the previous year by or on behalfof an employer or a former employer, if not charged to Income-tax in any earlierprevious year.\\nA reading of clauses (a), () and (c) of section 15 would show that under clause (a)salary income is chargeable on due basis; whereas under clauses () and (c) salaryincome is chargeable on payment basis. For the purposes of section 15, section 17includes within the meaning of the expression ‘salary’ certain benefits or perquisites \\n234A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \\nreceived by the employee from the employer. These are chargeable to tax when they\\nare allowed by the employer. For the purposes of the discussion that follows, thebasis under which such allowances are charged to tax is referred to as ‘allowancebasis’.\\n()Due basis.—As explained above, salary income is chargeable to tax either on‘due basis' or on ‘payment basis’ or, as it were, on ‘allowance basis’. Where thesalary has become due according to contract of service, it should be regarded asthe income of the previous year in which it becomes due, irrespective of whether\\n \\nit is paid or not [Bhuban Mohan Banerjee v CIT (1956) 29 ITR 229 (Cal)].\\nWhere the salary is foregone voluntarily, a distinction has to be made betweenthe salary foregone before it becomes due and the salary surrendered after itbecomes due or accrues. In the former case, there is accrual of salary while in thelatter case it would be an application of the salary which has become due andpayable [CJT v Mehar Singh Sampuran Singh Chawla (1973) 90 ITR 219 (Del)].\\n(2)Payment basis —Asis explained above, under clauses (2) and (c) of section 15salary income is chargeable on payment basis. Clause (6) of section 15 applieswhere the salary is not due, but is paid in advance. Clause (c) on the other hand,applies to arrears of salary of past years paid in subsequent years provided thesame had not been charged as income of the relevant past year or years. Thiskind of things may happen when services are rendered in past years but thequantum of payment to be made is not determined till a later year when on suchdetermination payment is to be made to the employee or where emoluments arerevised with retrospective effect for a past year or years. Clause (c) wili alsoapply when unpaid salary though due in past year or years was not assessed forany reason whatsoever; it would then become assessable when paid under clause\\n{c)...\\n(3)No option to choose the basis of charge —There is no option to the assessee oreven to the Assessing Officer to choose the basis of charge [Chuban MohanBanerjee y CIT (1956) 29 ITR 229 (Cal)].\\n(4)Allowancebasis-—Theword‘allowance’hasreferencetosomeoftheperquisites under the head ‘Salaries’ which cannot appropriately be said to be‘due’ or ‘paid’. Thus (a) a rent free accommodation provided to the employee, or\\n(6)facility of watchman, gardener, sweeper or any other domestic servantprovided to the employee or (c) free education provided to employees of thechildren of the employee is neither ‘due’ or ‘paid’ but is certainly allowed. Again\\nin respect of arrears of salary resulting from a retrospective sanction, the use ofthe word ‘allowed’ would be more appropriate than of the word ‘due’, before thearrears are actually paid.\\nWhere any salary paid in advance is included in the total income of any person\\nfor any previous year, it shall not be included again in the total income of theperson when the salary becomes due.\\nAny salary, bonus, commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, due\\nto or received by, a partner of a firm from the firm shall not be regarded as salaryfor the purpose of this section. The same shall be taxable under section 28. \\nComputation of Total Income235 \\nThe expression paid includes every receipt by the employee from the employerwhether it was due to him or not. The expression allowed is of wider connotationand any credit to the employee's account is covered, thereby and it should imply\\nthat right is conferred on the employee in respect of the same [C/T v Russel\\n(Z. W.) (1964) 53 ITR 91 (SC)].\\nArrears of salary are taxable on payment basis and not on due basis [SardarArjun Singh Alhuwalia v CIT (1980) 124 ITR 347 (MP).\\nAn employee is to be taxed on the salary income to which he is entitled toreceive during the relevant period. The reduction in his salary cannot be effectedwithretrospectiveeffect.Suchreductioncanoperateonly prospectively[Raghunathan (T.M.) v CIT (1998) 231 1TR 826 (Mad)].\\nIf the salary is payable on monthly basis, it normally becomes due at the end ofthe month although it is paid in the next month. In this case, it will be taxable on‘due’ basis because ‘due’ is earlier than ‘receipt’. Therefore, salary is normallytaxable from April to March as the salary of March becomes due at the end ofthe month. However, in some cases the salary becomes due on the 1st day of thenext month. In that case we shall tax the salary from March to February becausesalary of month of March of current year will be due only in the next financialyear and the salary of month of March of last previous year became due only on\\n1st April of the current year.\",\n",

But sometimes the employer,insteadof makingthe paymentinrespectof such monetaryobligationsorreimbursing such amount to the employee, provides the perquisite in the form of afacilitytothe employee. Such facility will bea perquisite only for specifiedemployees mentioned in section 17(2){iii). For example, if a watchman/sweeper isengaged by the employee and his wages are reimbursed/paid by the employer, it is aperquisite for all employees because it is the duty of the employee to pay the salaryof his watchman/sweeper. On the other hand, if the watchman/ sweeper is engagedby the employer and facility of his services is provided to the employee, it will be aperquisite only for specified employees.\\nAny benefit/amenity in the form of a facility (other than rent free accommodation,concession in the matter of rent or fringe benefits or amenities as may be prescribed)provided by the employer, which is not tax-free, shall be taxable only in the hands ofspecified employees.

As per section\\n2(32), person who has a substantial interest in the company, in relation to acompany meats a person who is the beneficial owner of shares, not being sharesentitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether with or without a right to participate\\nin profits, carrying not less than 20% of the voting power; Here the wordbeneficial owner is significant. It means that even if a person is not a registeredholder of shares in 2 company but has beneficial interest in such shares, he shailbe covered by this definition and conversely, even if a person is a registeredholders of shares but has no beneficial interest in such shares, he shail not becovered by this definition. Thus, the beneficial ownership is the criterion under\\nthis definition:\\nExample: Suppose R is an employee of X Ltd who is also registered shareholderof X Ltd as Karta of HUF of shares purchased with the funds of HUF. In this\\ncase, R cannot be called a specified employee since he has no beneficial interest\\nin the shares registered in his name.\\n(iii)his income under the head ‘Salaries’ (whether due from, or paid or allowed by,one or more employers), exclusive of the value of all benefits or amenities notprovided for by way of monetary payment, exceeds 250,000.

As the namesuggests, these payments are received by the employee in lieu of or in addition tosalary or wages. These payments include the following:\\n(1)Terminal Compensation: The amount of any compensation due to or received byan assessee from his employer or former employer at or in connection with the \\nComputation of Total Income-273 \\ntermination of his employment or the modification of the terms and conditionsrelating thereto is regarded as profits in lieu of salary. The termination may bedue to retirement, premature termination and resignation or otherwise.\\n(2)Paymentfromanunrecognisedprovidentfundoranunrecognizedsuperannuation fund: The next category of such profit in lieu of salary is,payment due to or received by an assessee from an unrecognised provident fund\\nor an unrecognised superannuation find to the extent to which such paymentdoes not consist of contributions by the employee or interest on such employee'scontribution. In other words, total employer's contribution till date and intereston such employer's contribution would both be taxable. The accumulatedbalance of an unrecognised provident fund and unrecognised superannuationfund, consists of the employee's own contribution plus interest thereon and theemployer’s contribution plusinterest thereon. Employer'scontributionandinterest thereon and interest on the employee's contribution are not taxed duringthe period of employment. When the accumulated balance of such a fund is paid\\nto the employee either on retirement or on termination of service, the untaxedportion, ie the employer's contribution and interest thereon is taxed as ‘profit inlie of salary’. The interest on employee's contribution is taxed as ‘Income fromother sources’ [CIT v G. Hyatt (1971) 80 ITR 177 (SC)}.\\n(3)Payment under Keyman Insurance Policy: Any payment due to or received by anemployee, under a Keyman Insurance Policy including the sum allocated by way\\nof bonus on such policy, will also be regarded as profit in lieu of salary.\\n(4)Any amount due or received before joining or after cessation of employment:Any amounts due to or received, whether in lump sum or otherwise by anyassessee from any person—\\n(A)before his joining any employment with that person; or\\n(B)after cessation of his employment with that person.\\noy)Any other sum received by the employee from the employer: All other paymentsmade by an employer to an employee, would be brought under the head ‘Profits\\nin lieu of salary’. Thisis a comprehensive provision by virtue of which allpayments made by an employer to an employee whether made in pursuance of alegal obligation or voluntarily are brought under profit in lieu of salary.\\nHowever, the following receipts, will not be termed as 'profits in lieu of salary' to theextent they are exempt under section 10.\\n(i)Death-cum-retirement gratuity — Section 10(10)\\n(i)Commuted value of pension — Section 10(10A)\\nii)Retrenchment compensation received by a workman —- Section 10(10B)\\n(i)Payment received from a statutory provident fund — Section 10(11)\\n1)Payment received from recognised provident fund — Section 10(12)\\n(vi)Any payment from an approved superannuation fund as per section 10(13)\\n(vii)House rent allowance exempt under section 10(13A) \\n274A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\\nIn short, except for the terminal and other payments specifically exempted underclauses (10) to (13A) of section 10, ail other payments received by an employee from\\nan employer or former employer are liable to tax under this head.\\n4,101What is the treatment of an amount received by an employee before joining orafter cession of employment?\\nAns.Any amounts due to or received, whether in lump sum or otherwise by any assesseefrom any person—\\n(A)before his joining any employment with that person; or\\n(B)after cessation of his employment with that person\\nare taxable as profits in lieu of salary.\\nNon-compete commission received by the employee for not competing with‘ theemployer is liable to be taxed under the inclusive definition of salary under section17 of the Act.

Further, as per section 9(1)(ii),income which falls under the head salaries shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India\\nif it is earned in India and in this case not only resident but non-resident shall also beliable to be taxed in India though it may be paid in India or outside provided theservices are rendered by non-resident in India.\\nIt will also include salary of the rest period or leave period which is preceded andsucceeded by services rendered in India and forms part of the service contract ofemployment.\\nThe result of this provision is that the payment or receipt of salary is immaterial.

Consequently, a pensionlike salary, though paid abroad, is chargeable if the pensioner had worked in India.\\nIf the payment of home salary abroad by the foreign company to the expatriate hasany connection or nexus with his rendition of service in India, then such paymentwould constitute income which is deemed to accrue or arise to the recipient in India\\nas salary earned in India in terms of section 9(1)(ii) of the Act [CIT v Eli Lilly andCo.

Lid. vy ACIT (2046) 386 ITR 500 (SC)]\\n(i)Before dealing with the respective contentions, we may state, in a summaryform, schemeof the Act about the computation of the total income. Section 4 of\\nthe Act is the charging Section as per which the total income of an assessee,subject to statutory exemptions, is chargeable to tax. Section 14 of the Actenumerates five heads of income for the purpose of charge of income tax andcomputation of total income. These are: Salaries, Income from house property,Profits and gains of business or profession, Capital gains and Income from othersources. A particular income, therefore, has to be classified in one of theaforesaid heads. It is on that basis rules for computing income and permissibledeductions which are contained in different provisions of the Act for each of theaforesaid heads, are to be applied. For example, provisions for computing theincome from house property are contained in Sections 22 to 27 of the Act andprofits and gains of business or profession are to be computed as per theprovisions contained in Sections 28 to 44DB of the Act. It is also to be borne inmind that income tax is only One Tax which is levied on the sum total of theincome classified and chargeable under the various heads. It is not a collectionof distinct taxes levied separately on each head of the income.\\n(ii) There may be instances where a particular income may appear to fall in morethan one head. These kind of cases of overlapping have frequently arisen underthe two heads with which we are concerned in the instant case as well, namely,income from the house property on the one hand and profits and gains frombusiness on the other hand. On the facts of a particular case, income has to beeither treated as income from the house property or as the business income.Tests which are to be applied for determining the real nature of income are laiddown in judicial decisions, on the interpretation of the provisions of these twoheads, Wherever there is an income from leasing out of premises and collecting\\nrent, normally such an income is to be treated as income from house property, \\nIncome under the Head \\'Income from House Property’303 \\nin case provisions of Section 22 of the Act are satisfied with primary ingredientthat the assessee is the owner of the said building or lands appurtenant thereto.Section 22 of the Act makes ‘annual value’of such a property as incomechargeable to tax under this head. How annual value is to be determined isprovided in Section 23 of the Act. ‘Owner of the house property’ is defined inSection 27 of the Act which includes certain situations where a person notactually the owner shall be treated as deemed owner of a building or partthereof. In the present case, the appellant is held to be “deemed owner” of theproperty in question by virtue of Section 27(iiib) of the Act. On the other hand,under certain circumstances, where the income may have been derived fromletting out of the premises, it can still be treated as business income if lettingout of the premises itself is the business of the assessee.\\n(iii)\\nWhat is the test which has to be applied to determine whether the income wouldbe chargeable under the head “income from the house property” or it would bechargeable under the head “Profits and gains from business or profession”, is\\nthe question. Jt may be mentioned, in the first instance, that merely becausethere is an entry in the object clause of the business showing a particular object,would not be the determinative factor to arrive at a conclusion that the income\\nis to be treated as income from business. Such a question would depend upon\\nthe circumstances of each case. It is so held by the Constitution Bench of thisCourt in Sultan Bros. (P) Ltd. v CIT (1964) 5 SCR 807\\n(iv)In view thereof, the object clause, as contained in the partnership deed, wouldnot be the conclusive factor. Matter has to be examined on the facts of each case\\nas held in Sultan Bros. (P) Ltd. case. Even otherwise, the object clause which iscontained in the partnership firm is to take the premises on rent and to sub-let.\\nIn the present case, reading of the object clause would bring out two discernible\\nfacts, which are as follows:\\n(a)The appellant which is a partnership firm is to take the premises on rentand to sub-let those premises. Thus, the business activity is of taking thepremises on rent and sub-letting them. In the instant case, by legal fictioncontained in Section 27(iiib) of the Act, the appellant is treated as “deemedowner”.\\n(b}The aforesaid clause also mentions that partnership firm may take anyother business as may be mutually agreed upon by the partners.\\n(v)In the instant case, therefore,it is to be seen as to whether the activity inquestion was in the nature of business by which it could be said that incomereceived by the appellant was to be treated as income from the business. Before\\nus, apart from relying upon the aforesaid clause in the partnership deed to show\\nits objective, the learned counsel for the appellant has not produced or referred\\nto any material. The ITAT being the last forum insofar as factual determination\\nis concerned, these findings have attained finality. In any case, as mentionedabove, the learned counsel for the appellant did not argue on this aspect and didnot make any efforts to show as to how the aforesaid findings were perverse. Itwas for the appellant to produce sufficient material on record to show that its \\n304A Compendium of fssues on Income Tax\\nentire income or substantial income was from letting out of the property whichwas the principal business activity of the appellant. No such effort was made.\\n\\'(vi) However, the Supreme Court in the case of Raj Dadarkar & Associates vy ACIT\\n(2017) 81 taxmann.com 193 (SC) held that reliance placed by the appellant onthe judgments of this Court in Chennai Properties & Investments Ltd 373 ITR\\n_ 673 (SC) and Rayala Corporation (P) Ltd. would be of no avail. In ChennaiProperties & Investments Ltd. where one of us (Sikri, J.) was a part of theBench found that the entire income of the appellant was through letting out ofthe two properties it owned and there was no other income of the assessceexcept the income from letting out of the said properties, which was thebusiness of the assessee. On those facts, this Court came to the conclusion thatjudgment of this Court in Karanpura Development Co. Lid.vy CIT, (1962) 44ITR 362 was applicable and the judgment of this Court in East India Housingand Land Development Trust Ltd. v CIT (1961) 42 ITR 49 was held to bedistinguishable. In the present case, we find that situation is just the reverse. InRayala Corporation (P) Lid., fact situation was identical to the case of ChennaiProperties & Investments Lid. and for this reason, Rayala Corporation (P) Ltd.followedChennai Properties&InvestmentsLtd, whichisheldtobeinapplicable in the instant case.\\n \\nWhere the prime object is to let out property alongwith additional right of usingJurniture and fixtures, the income is chargeable under the head house properiy:Where the prime object of the assessee under the said agreement was to let outportion of said property to various occupants by giving them additional right of usingfurniture and fixtures and other common facilities for which rent was being paidmonth by month in addition to the security free advance covering the entire cost ofthe said immovable property, the income derived from the said property was anincome from property and not income from business,as the property was notexploited as business asset [Shambhu Investment (P.)

However inKarnani Properties Lid v CIT (1971) 82 ITR 547 (SC) on the facts found by theTribunal, it was held that similar service rendered by the assessee to its tenantswere the result of its activities carried on continuously in an organised manner,with a set purpose and with a view to earning profits. Hence, those activitieswere business activities and taxable under section 28.\\n(b)Composite rent on account of rent for the property and hire charges of otherassets: Composite rent on account of rent for the property and the hire charges ofmachinery, plant or furniture belonging to the owner. In this case if the letting ofthe property is separable from the letting of the other assets, then the portion ofthe rent attributable to the letting of the premises shall be assessable as ‘Incomefrom House Property\\' and the other portion of the composite rent for letting otherassets shall be assessable either as ‘Profits and Gains of Business or Profession’\\nor ‘Income from Other Sources’.

The AssessingOfficer rejected the claim of standard deduction on the ground that impugned receipttowards installation of antenna\" was taxable as “income from other sources\". Onappeal the CIT(A) upheld the order of AO on following basis:\\nIt relied on judgment of High Court of Caicutta in case of Mukherjee State Pvt. Ltd vCIT [2000] 113 TAXMAN 313 (CAL.) wherein it was held that if rent was only forfixing the hoarding, it could not be treated as part of the building, nor it could betreated as land appurtenant thereto. Therefore such income be separately considered\\nas income from other sources. On the same analogy the CIT(A) held that rent frominstallation of mobile antennae erected on the top of the building would not betaxable under the head “income from house property\", as the same could not betreated as part of the building nor be treated as land appurtenant thereto. On appealthe Tribunal held as under\\nThe relianceon judgment of Mukerjee Estates (Supra) was wholly misplaced,wherein the Tribunal had given a categorical finding that the assessee had let out thehoardings and not the roof of building. It was in this backdrop the High Court heldthat rent was taken as rent for hoardings per se rather than rights on the roof wherehoardings could be installed. Once the CIT(A) agreed that rent was only forproviding space for installation of mobile antennae, there was no occasion toconsider whether antenna would be a part of building or land appurtenant thereto asthe true test was whether such a space, rented out, was part of the building or landappurtenant thereto? What was relevant was the space which had been rented out \\nincome under the Head \\'Income from House Property’313 \\nand, therefore, as long as the space was part of the building, the rent was required tobe treated as “income from house property\".

These are:\\ni)Actual rent received or receivable\\nActual rent received/receivable is an important factor in determining the annualvalue of a property though this is not the only decisive factor. The actual rentcould be dependent upon various considerations. There could be circumstanceswhere the owner agrees to bear certain obligations of the tenant eg the water andelectricity bills of the tenant may be payable by the owner. In this case, the deFacto rent will be calculated by stepping down the rent received/receivable by theamount spent by the owner on meeting the obligation of the tenant.

Such rent is known as composite rent. The said compositerent can fali under 2 categories:\\n(a)composite rent on account of rent for the property and service charges forvarious facilities provided alongwith the house like lift, gas, water, electricity,watch and ward, air conditioning etc In this case such composite rent should be\\nsplit up and the portion of rent attributable to the letting of the premises shall beassessable as “Income from House Property\". The other portion of the compositerent received for rendering services shall be assessable as \"Income from OtherSources\" [CIT v Kanak Investments P. Ltd (1974) 95 ITR 419 (Cal)]. However inKarnani Properties Lid v CIT (1971) 82 ITR 547 (SC) on the facts found by theTribunal, it was held that similar service rendered by the assessee to its tenantswere the result of its activities carried on continuously in an organised manner,with a set purpose and with a view to earning profits. Hence, those activitieswere business activities and taxable under section 28.\\n(6)composite rent on account of rent for the property and the hire charges ofmachinery, plant or furniture belonging to the owner. In this case if the letting ofthe property is separable from the letting of the other assets, then the portion of\\n-the rent attributable to the letting of the premises shall be assessable as \"Incomefrom House Property\" and the other portion of the composite rent for lettingother assets shall be assessable either as “Profits and Gains of Business orProfession\" or \"Income from Other Sources”. On the other hand, if the letting of\\nthe propertyis inseparable from the letting of other assets like machinery,furniture, the entire income would be taxable as \"Profits and Gains of Business\\nor Profession” or \"Income from Other Sources\".\\nIncome from shopping complex held to be partly business income and partly incomefrom house property if the rent received is not composite rent: Ownership of propertyand leasing it out may be done as a part of business, or it may be done as a landowner. Whether it is the one or the other must necessarily depend upon the objectwith which the act is done. When a company is formed with the specific object ofacquiring properties not with the view to leasing them as property but to selling them\\nor turning them to account even by way of leasing them out as an integral part of itsbusiness,it cannot be said to treat them as landowner but as trader.

If the actual rent so received or receivable as per clause\\n(6) is more than the reasonable expected rent computed as per clause (a), the GrossAnnual Value shall be the actual rent so received or receivable.

It is not essential to thecarrying on of a business that the people who carry it on should make a profit or eventhat they should desire or wish to do so. [Sarojini Rajah v CIT (1969) 71 ITR 504(Mad)].\\nTo regard an activity as business, there must be a course of dealings continued orcontemplated to be continued with a profit motive and not for sport or pleasure[Bharat Development (P) Ltd v CIT (1982) 133 ITR 470 (Del)].\\nWhere the assessee had been carrying on the activity of sale, lease and maintenanceof the horses in an organized manner, not only in the year in question but also inearlier and subsequent years, and had carried on the activity with a profit motive, theactivities of the assessee were business activities and there was a profit elementinvolved in the carrying on the activity. The income that arose from the lease andsale of horses was business income and the proceeds from sale of horses are notcovered under the head capital gains.

InKikabhai Premchand (Sir) v CIT (1953) 24 ITR 506 (SC), the Supreme Court alsopointed out that it was unreal and artificial to separate the business from its ownerand treat them as if they were separate entities trading with each other and then bymeans of a fictional sale introduce a fictional profit which in truth and im fact wasnon-existent and that a man could not trade with himself nor could he make profit orloss out of transactions with himself.',\n",

Itmay even be stated to be a way of living or a sphere of activity for which one has aspecial fitness, though it is not necessary that the activity should be indulged in forpurposes of livelihood [Ramaswami Gounder (K.) v CIT (1987) 163 ITR 94 (Mad)].\\nIn order that an activity may be called a vocation, it need not be shown that it is anorganised activity and that it is indulged in with a profit-motive [Krishna Menon (P.)\\nv CIT (1959) 35 ITR 48 (SC)].\\nProfession is a word of wide import and includes ‘vocation’ which is only a way ofliving and a person can have more than one vocation and the vocation need not be forlivelihood nor for making any income nor need it involve systematic and organizedactivity. The mere fact that the teaching of Vedanta was a mater of religion wouldnot mean that the assessee was not carrying on a vocation.

It can becarried through his agent or servant. Further, the person that is fiable to be assessed isgenerally the owner or proprietor of the business but sometimes a representative ofsuch owner may be assessed if such representative had a right to carry on thebusiness and he did so carry on, as for example, a guardian of an infant conducting abusiness which belongs to the infant, particularly under the orders of court. Thus, ithas been held that where the court takes away the right of the owner to carry on hisown business and appoints somebody else to carry on the business, the owner willnot be assessable on the income of such profits [Saifudin Ali Mohamed v.CIT (1954)25 ITR 237 (Bom)]. So also, where a receiver or receivers carried on business onbehalf of certain beneficiaries or persons entitled to it under the directions fromcourt, it was held that the department, in order to assess, the profits as a whole, couldassess the receivers as carrying on business in their own right under orders of court[Ramaswamy Iyengar (V.) v CIT (1960) 40 ITR 377 (Mad)].

       "  'content': '6.61What are general principles followed for allowability of deductions under thehead profits and gains of business or profession?\\nAns.The following principles! should be followed for allowability of deductions:\\n(1) Expenditure should have been incurred during the previous year: Any loss orexpenditure can be claimed as a deduction, only if it has been incurred during therelevant previous year. For this purpose, we haveto keepin mind method ofaccounting followed by the assessee. If the assessee follows the cash system ofaccounting, only those expenses which have been actually paid during the previousyear shall be allowable. On the other hand, if the assessee follows the mercantilesystem of accounting then the expenses incurred during the previous year can beallowed irrespective of the fact whether they have been actually paid or not.\\nBenefit of expenditure may extend beyond the year of expenditure: It is not necessarythat the benefit of the expenditure should be confined to the year of expenditure. Forinstance, the benefit of repairs executed in any year would naturally enure for severalfuture years, but the expenditure cannot be disailowed for the reason.\\n(2) Expenditure should be incurred for the purpose of the business: An expenditurecan be allowed as deduction only if it has been incurred for the purpose of thebusiness of the assessee. Any expenditure not incurred for the assessee’s ownbusiness shall not be allowed as a deduction. It is not necessary that the expenditureshould result in any profit to the assessee. What is essential is that the expenditure isincurred for the purpose of the business. It is also not essential that it should beincurred to earn a profit. Expenditure incurred for preservation of the business,rationalisation of the administrationand modernisationof the equipmentareallowable expenses.\\nIncidental benefit enuring to a third party is no bar to deduction: If the payment orexpenditure is incurred for the purpose of the trade of the assessee, it does not matterthat the payment may enure incidentally for the benefit of a third party.\\n(3) No deduction is allowable in respect of a discontinued business: It is necessarythat the business, in respect of which the expenses are incurred should have beencarried on by the assessee during the previous year. In respect of the business which\\n \\n1In this connection, also refer Question Numbers 6.62, 6.63 and 6.64 relating to ICDS. \\n386A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\\nhas been discontinued before the commencement of the previous year, the assesseecannot claim any expenditure/loss during the previous year.\\nAllowances, eg interest on money borrowed, write off of allowances and bad debts,which relate to business, closed before the commencement of the previous yearcannot be deducted from or set off against the profit of a separate existing business.\\n \\nIf, however, a business is carried on for some time in the accounting year, section 28\\nis attracted.\\nWhere one business activity has been discontinued and another continues to exist it\\nis a mixed question of fact and law whether the discontinued activity was separateand distinct from the existing business or whether it was merely the branch of theexisting business and the two constituted one and the same business. In the lattercase,theallowancespertainingto discontinuedactivitycanbedeductedincomputing the profit of existing business but not in the former case.\\nThe assessee company had started manufacturing of powdered soft drink. During theaccounting year relevant to the assessment year 2003-04,it decided to stop itsmanufacturing activity as it was found to be non-profitable. Many of employees whowere directly in the manufacturing activity were laid off and the severance costs tothose employees were paid. Assessee continued to do the trading activity. The Courtheld that suspension of one of the activities did not amount to closer of business,hence the expenditure was allowable [C77 v Kjs India P. Ltd, (2012) 340 ITR 380(Del)].\\nSection 176(3A) and 176(4) provide the exception where the income of a business orprofession received in an previous year subsequent to the year of discontinuance of\\nthe business or profession is brought to charge. In such cases, expenses incurred after\\nthe year of discontinuance to earn such income should be allowed as deduction.\\n(4) Expenses incurred before the setting up of a business are not allowed: As ageneral rule, any expenditure incurred prior to the setting up of business is notallowable as a deduction as the previous year of a new business commences on thedate when the business is set up. A business is set up when it is established or set onfoot. There may be an interregnum between the setting up of a business and its actualcommencement. Expenses incurred after setting up of the business but before theactual commencement of business can be allowed as a deduction under sections 30 to\\n37.\\nA unit cannot be said to have been set up unless it is ready to discharge the function\\nfor which it is being set up. Setting up of business is distinct from commencement ofbusiness. It is only when the unit has been put into such a shape that it can startfunctioning as a business or a manufacturing organisation that it can be said that theunit has been set up. Expenses incurred after the setting up of the business aredeductible as revenue expenditure [DHL Express (1) Pvt. Ltd v ACIT (2009) 124 TTJ108 (Mum)].\\n(5) No deduction is allowed on account of loss of wasting assets: The Act providesfor no allowance in respect of wasting assets, except as regards tangible assets bybuildings, machinery, land or furniture, intangible assets being know-how patents,copyrightslicence, farmableor any other businessor commenceright under \\nincome under the Head ‘Profits and Gains of Business or Profession’387 \\nsection 32, and as regards animals under section 36(1)(vi). The general principle is\\nthat, everything of the nature of income shall be assessed from whatsoever source itmay be derived, whether temporary or permanent steady or fluctuating, precarious orsecure.In arrivingat profits,itis immaterialto consider whether the capital-investment by which the profits are earned remains unconsumed or undiminished, orgets consumed in the process of yielding income. Thus if a coal mine is beingworked and is getting exhausted by the constant removal of coal, no deduction ispermissible on account of the exhaustion of coal.\\n(6) Reserves/provisions for contingencies or anticipated losses cannot be claimed as\\na deduction: In cases where the assessee provides for any contingent liability likebad debts, sales tax, ete which have not arisen during the previous year but are onlyanticipated to arise in the future, no deduction is allowable. Deduction can beclaimed only when the expenditure or the loss has been actually incurred during theprevious year.',\n",

The Websters New International Dictionary defines theword building as that which is built specifically: (a) as now generally used a fabric oredifice, framed or constructed, designed to stand more or less permanently andcovering a space of land for use as a dwelling, store house, factory, shelter for beasts\\nor some other useful purpose. Building in this sense does not include a mere wall,fence, monument, hoarding or similar structure though designed for permanent usewhereit stands, nor a steamboat, ship or other vessel of navigation. From thisdefinition it does not appear that the existence of a roof is always necessary for astructure to be regarded as a building. Residential buildings ordinarily have roofs butthere can be a non-residential building of which a roof is not necessary.

       "  'content': \"6.111Will depreciation be allowed on the asset acquired by directors on behalf ofcompany?\\nAns.The allowability of depreciation to the company where the assets are acquired by the:directors has been analysed in the following judicial decisions:\\n1. Buses were initially purchased by the directors of the assessee-company and thefinance was raised by them from bankers in their individual names. However, thebuses were taken over by the assessee by resolution dated October 30, 1988. Theincome of the said buses was shown and assessed in the hands of the assessee-company and the expenses relating to these buses on account of interest paid to thebank, insurance, hire purchase charges and salaries to the drivers were also beingclaimed asa deduction by the assessee-company. The costs of the buses werereflected in the balance-sheet of the company and the liability towards ‘the bankagainst these buses on account of ‘term joan’ was also reflected under the head‘Secured loans’. The Assessing Officer refused to allow depreciation on the buses in\\nthe hands of the company. The Tribunai concluded that there was ample evidence onrecord to show that the assessee had taken over the buses from the directors and themere fact that they were not got registered in the names of the assessee could not be\\na ground for disallowing the claim of depreciation. The assessee was entitled todepreciation on the buses which were standing in the names of the directors [CIT vFazilka Dabwali TPT. Co. Pvt. Ltd (2004) 270 ITR 398 (P&H)j.\\n2. However, where an assessee company claim depreciation on vehicle purchased inname of director and finding of the authorities were that the assessee company hadno dominion over vehicle and there was no material to show use of vehicle for thepurpose of the business of the assessee company, it was held that the ownership of anasset in his personal capacity by the director of the company cannot be an assetdeemed to be in the vested ownership or beneficial utility of the company. They weretwo distinct and independent legal entities. This was not a question of law, but wasprimarily a question of fact. All the three authorities had given additional reasons forrejecting the claim of depreciation. No records were produced by the assessee toshow that the utility of the vehicle was in the normal course for the benefit of thecompany. In fact, according to the findings recorded by the Tribunal, even beneficial \\n446A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax \\nownership did not vest in the assessee-company. There was no reason to disturb theconcurrent view taken by the authorities [AZ.M. Fisheries Pvt. Lid v CIT (2005) 277ITR 204 (Del)].\\n3. Vehicles though registered in the names of the directors were used for the purposeof business of the company, company entitled to claim depreciation. The Court heldthat the assessee is not entitled to higher rate of depreciation when the assessee hadgiven vehicles on lease [C/T v Aravali Finlease Lid. (2012) 341 ITR 282 (Gu)j)].\\n4. Where the trucks were purchased in the name of directors of assessee company butmoney invested was out of the funds of the company, the company shall be defactoowner of trucks and would be entitled to depreciation [C7T v Varanasi Auto SalesPyt. Ltd. (2010) 326 ITR 182 (All)].\\n-S. Depreciation under section 32 was allowable to the assessee company on the\\nassets which were purchased in the name of the managing director of the assesseecompany and his wife but, used exclusively for the assessee's business [C/T vMetaiman Auto P. Ltd. (2011) 52 DTR 385 (P&H)].\\n6. Vehicles though registered in the names of the directors were used for the purposeof business of the company, company entitled to claim depreciation. The Court held\\nthat the assessee is not entitled to higher rate of depreciation when the assessee hadgiven vehicles on lease [CIT v Aravali Finlease Ltd. (2012) 341 ITR 282 (Guj)].\\n7. The decision in Mysore Minerals Lid v CIT (1999) 239 ITR 775 (SC) hasrecognised the right of beneficial owner to depreciation, so that this issue can nolonger squarely apply for assessee’s claim for depreciation on the vehicle. In fact,even prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in Mysore Minerals’ case, the HighCourts in the case of vehicles had uniformly taken the view that registration underMotor Vehicles Act does not confer any title and that registration certificate notbeing a document of title, depreciation could not be refused [C7T v Salkia TransportAssociates (1983) 143 ITR 39 (Cal); CIT v Amber Corporation (1981) 127 ITR 29(Raj) again which SLP was refused (1983) 142 ITR (St.) 6; CIT v Royal AmberResorts (1987) 164 ITR 311 (Raj); C22’ v Nidish Transport Corpn (1990) 185 ITR669 (Ker); CIT’ v Basti Sugar Mills Co Lid (2002) 257 ITR 88 (Del)].\",\n",

It was so held in Atlas CycleIndustries Lid v CIT (2004) 270 ITR 108 (P&H). However, courts have also foundthat notwithstanding the form in which the agreement is worded, the substance of theagreement could be different, when for example, it is found that in case of hire-purchase agreement in truck financing, it is the truck operator, who is entitled todepreciation with the form of hire purchase agreement being understood as one forbetter security for the financier without any intention to hold title over the property.\\nIt is for this reason that even registration certificate in case of motor vehicles has notbeen considered as document of title, so that the ownership is ordinarily determinedwith reference to the law relating to movable property, where there is transfer ofownership when the consideration is paid and delivery is taken. \\n450A Compendium of Issues on Income Tax\\nIn the case of hire purchase agreement, the ownership would depend upon the terms\\nof the agreement which has to be produced before the Assessing Officer to obtainallowance in respect of depreciation of assets purchased on hire-purchase basis [C/T(Addl) v General Industries Corpn (1985) 155 IFR 430 (Del); CIT v Nagpur GoldenTransport Co.

Depreciation should be allowed to the lessee on the entirepurchase price as per agreement.\\n(3)Where the terms of the agreement provide that the equipment shall eventuallybecome the property of the hirer or confer on the hirer an option to purchase theequipment, the transaction should be regarded as one of hire-purchase. In suchcases the periodical payments made by the hirer should for tax purposes beregarded as made up of:\\n(a)consideration for hire, to be allowed as a deduction in the assessment, and\\n(b)payment on account of purchase to be treated as capital outlay, depreciationbeing allowed to the lessee on the initial value (eg the amount for which thehired subject would have been sold for cash at the date of agreement).\\n(4)The allowance to be made in respect of hire should be the difference between theaggregate amount of the periodical payments under the agreement and the initialvalue (as described above), the amount of this allowance being spread evenlyover the term of the agreement. If, however, the agreement was terminated eitherby the outright purchase of equipment or of its return to the owner, the deductionshould cease as from the date of the termination. \\nIncome under the Head ‘Profits and Gains of Business or Profession’451 \\n(5)An assessee claiming this deduction should be asked to furnish a certificate, fromthe vendor or other satisfactory evidence, of the initial value (as describedabove). Where no certificate or satisfactory evidence is forthcoming, the initialvalue should be arrived at by computing the present value of the amount payableunder the agreement at an appropriate rate per centum; in doubtful cases the factsshould be reported to the Board.\\nThus in case of hire purchase agreement of the nature mentioned in para (3) of theabove circular, depreciation will be allowed on the cash down price of the asset and\\nthe interest charges be treated as consideration for hire and allowed as a deduction.\\nHirer of an asset under hire purchase agreement is entitled to depreciation in view ofthe CBDT Circular No. 9 dated 23-3-1943 [CIT v Kaveri Engineering Industries(2011) 53 DTR 102 (Mad)).\\nWhere under the agreement, the machinery is to become the property of the assesseeon payment of entire price of hire purchase on the expiry of 3 years and the entireprice is not so paid, depreciation would not be allowable to the assessee in respect ofthe machinery [Chaganial Automobiles v CIT (1985) 156 ITR 58 (Raj)].\\nHowever, where these were no such agreement and the trucks were purchased onhire purchase basis, the assessee was held to be owner thereof and was alloweddepreciation [C/T v Nagpur Golden Transport Co.

       "  'content': '6.278Is there any form or manner of writing off a bad debt?\\nAns.No particular form or manner of writing off a bad debt has been prescribed or\\n.provided for. According to the Dictionary for Accountants by Eric L. Kohler, 5thEdition, the expression write off means to transfer the balance of an accountpreviously regarded as an asset to an expense account or to profit and loss account.\\nAll that the definition of Kohler shows, is that an account which was previouslyshown as an asset must be transferred to an expense account or the profit and lossaccount. It is not essential that the debtor’s individual account should be squared offby an appropriate credit entry. Even if the credit is made in a bad debt reserveaccount against debit to the profit and loss account indicating that the entry refers toamounts due by the particular debtoror debtors,the writing offis complete[Vithaldas H. Dhanjibhai Bardanwala v CIT (1981) 130 ITR 95 (Guj)]. Similarly,where the assessee had debited a debt as irrecoverable in his profit and loss accountcrediting it, not in the debtor’s personal ledger account but to a new doubtful debtsand suspense account, it was held that the writing off was not defective [CIZ/EPT vJwala Prasad Tewari (1953) 24 ITR 537 (Bom). See also C/T v General FibreDealers (2000) 246 ITR 686 (Cal) and CiT v General Insurance Corporation ofIndia (No. 2) (2002) 254 ITR 204 (Bom)]. However, the Allahabad High Court has.held that where an assessee had written off bad debts by debiting profit and lossaccount but instead of making a corresponding credit entry in account of debtor, hemade an entry under head ‘provision for doubtful debts’ provision of section36(1)(@ii) was not complied with and hence, deduction is not permissible [JubilantOrganosys v CIT (2004) 265 ITR 420 (All).\\nFor an amount to be treated as a bad debt and to be allowed as an expenditurei in year\\nin which it was written off, assessee has to prove that bad debt had been written offand that bad debt had been taken into account in computing income of assessee inany one of years mentioned in clause (i) of sub-section (2) of section 36. [StockpointShare Services (P.) Ltd. v ACIT (2017) 86 taxmann.com 206 (Ker)}\\nWhere assessee had written off bad debt in its books of account and simultaneouslyreduced corresponding amount from loans and advances to debtors, it was held thatassessee would be entitled to deduction under section 36(1)(vii); it was not necessaryfor assessee to close individual account of each of its debtors in its books. [C/T vNewanagar Co-operative Bank Ltd.

However, the assessee could not be permitted to write off the debt fong afterfinalisation of accounts and claim deduction thereof in reassessment proceedings[CIT v Hotel Ambassador (2002) 253 ITR 430 (Ker)).\\nWhere accounts of assessee were open and subject to correction by auditors, baddebts could be written off even after closure of accounting period, as there is neitherany condition nor any provision under section 36(1)(vii}, that writing off of bad debtshould be done in relevant previous year, i.e., before end of financial year.

When are the expenses said\\nto be of a personal nature?\\nAns.Section37(1)expresslyforbidsdeductionof any expenditure whichcan becharacterisedas personal. Therefore, personal expenses of an assessee are notallowable as business expenditure in the computation of the profits and gains of anybusiness or profession carried on by him.\\nIn State of Madras v Coelho (G.J.) (1964) 53 ITR 186 (SC), the Supreme Courtexplained that personal expenses would include expenses on the person of theassessee or to satisfy his personal needs such as clothes, food, etc., for purposes notrelated to the business for which the deduction is claimed. It was further explained\\nthat every expense to discharge a personal obligation cannot become a personalexpense. For instance, it was held that payment of interest, on the facts, even though\\nit was in discharge of a personal obligation, was not a personal expense and was,therefore, held to be a permissible deduction.\\nInterest paid on a borrowing to enable an assessee to make a gift to meet a personalobligation cannot be deducted [Madhav Prasad Jatiav CIT (1979) 118 ITR 200\\n{SC)].\\nDue to exercise of his business or profession in very uncomfortable conditions, anassessee may fall ill and unless he gets well, he cannot carry on his business orprofession.

The only general principle that can be derived is that under the terms of\\nan agreement, if the assessee acquires a benefit of enduring nature that will constituteacquisition of an asset, any amount paid for the same wil! constitute capitalexpenditure. On the other hand,if the assessee has acquired merely technicalknowledge for the manufacture of any particular item for a specified duration, the\\n_ expenditure is of revenue nature [Jonas Woodhead & Sons (Undia) Ltd v CIT (1979)\\n117 ITR 55 (Mad)(FB)].\\nExpenditure for acquisition of technical know-how could be either capital or revenueexpenditure depending upon the purpose for which the technical know-how wasacquired. If it is for a running business, there will be no difficultyin getting itallowed as revenue deduction [Scientific Engineering House Pvt. Lid v CIT (1986)157 ITR 86 (SC)]. Where, what is paidis only for the use of assets, it wouldordinarily be chargeable as revenue expenditure [C/T v .4.E.C. (Pumps) Lid (1998)232 ITR 316 (SC)]. But where it is completely new technology for manufacture of”new product, it may well be treated as capital expenditure (CIT v W.S. Insulators ofIndia Lid (2000) 243 ITR 348 (Mad)]. The fact that the know-how was for thepurpose of a new product need not always mean that it is a capital expenditure, if it isone of many products manufactured by the assessee, Since technology in moderncontext has a high rate of obsolescence, it often qualifies for treatment as having arevenue character rather than capital one.\\nIn Eimco K.C.P. Lid v CIT (2000) 242 ITR 659 (SC), where technical know-how wasacquired by a newly floated company by allotting shares to the foreign company, theSupreme Court observed that the effect of the transaction was to reimburse thecontribution by the foreign company by way of know-how which could never betreated as expenditure, much less an expenditure laid out wholly & exclusively forpurpose of the business. \\n \\nIncome under the Head ‘Profits and Gains of Business or Profession’647 ',\n",

If so, it is not allowable under theseprovisions. If, on the other hand, the expenditure is of revenue character, the samewill be allowable. Secondly,.in order to see whether a payment is by way of businessexpenditure admissible under these provisions the test is whether the payment can berelated wholly and solely to the business expediency.

Held, the payment of a lump sum was also admissible\\nas revenue expenditure [C77 v Dalmia Dadri Cement Lid (1970) 77 ITR 410 (Pun)].\\nThe amount of compensation paid for premature termination of a trade agreementwas held deductible as the same was to avoid commercial inconveniences occurring\\nin future and did not bring into existence any capital asset of enduring nature.

When a company issuesdebentures at a discount, it incurs a liability to pay a larger amount than what it hasborrowed, at a future date. One need not go into the question whether this additionalliability equivalent to the discount, which is incurred in praesenti but is payable infuture, represents deferred interest or not. That may depend upon the totality ofcircumstances relating to the issue of debentures, including its terms. The liability,however, to pay the discounted amount over and above the amount received for thedebentures, is a liability which has been incurred by the company for the purposes of\\nits business in order to generate funds for its business activities. The amount soobtained by issue of debentures are used by the company for the purposes of itsbusiness.This would, therefore, be expenditure [Madras Industrial InvestmentCorporation Lid v CIT (1997) 225 ITR 802 (SC)].

This was amended by the legislature to be replaced by the expression“an account payee cheque or account payee bank draft\". This was donein thebackground of the experience that even crossed cheques were being endorsed infavour of a person other than the drawee making it difficult to trace the constituent ofthe money. To plug this possible loophole the requirement of section 40A(3) wasmade more stringent. If we accept the contention of counsel for the assessee thatthere was no distinction between a crossed cheque and an account payee cheque, wewould be obliterating this amendment brought in the statute with specific purpose inmind. Accordingly, payment by a crossed cheque is subject to disallowance undersection 40A(3). [Rajmoti Industries v ACIT (Guj) (2014) 45 taxmann.com 72 (Guj)]',\n",

[C7T vMaharaja Shree Umaid Milis Lid.
